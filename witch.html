King Arthur was ambushed and imprisoned by the monarch of a neighboring
kingdom. The monarch could have killed him, but was moved by Arthur's youthful
happiness. So he offered him freedom, as long as he could answer a very
difficult question. Arthur would have a year to figure out the answer;
if, after a year, he still had no answer, he would be killed.</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>T</font></font><font color="#CC0000">he
question was: What do women really want?</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>S</font></font><font color="#CC0000">uch
a question would perplex even the most knowledgeable man, and to young
Arthur, it seemed an impossible query. Well, since it was better than death,
he accepted the monarch's proposition to have an He returned to his kingdom
and began to poll everybody: the princess, the prostitutes, the priests,
the wise men, the court jester. In all, he spoke with everyone but no one
could give him a satisfactory answer. What most people did tell him was
to consult the old witch, as only she would know the answer. The price
would be high, since the witch was famous throughout the kingdom for the
exorbitant prices she charged.</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>T</font></font><font color="#CC0000">he
last day of the year arrived and Arthur had no alternative but to talk
to the witch. She agreed to answer his question, but he'd have to accept
her price first: The old witch wanted to marry Gawain, the most noble of
the Knights of the Round Table and Arthur's closest friend!</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Y</font></font><font color="#CC0000">oung
Arthur was horrified: she was hunchbacked and awfully hideous, had only
one tooth, smelled like sewage water, often made obscene noises... He had
never run across such a repugnant creature. He refused to force his friend
to marry her and have to endure such a burden.</font>

upon learning of the proposal, spoke with Arthur. He told him that nothing
was too big of a sacrifice compared to Arthur's life and the preservation
of the Round Table.</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>H</font></font><font color="#CC0000">ence,
their wedding was proclaimed, and the witch answered Arthur's question:</font>
<br><font color="#CC0000">What a woman really wants is to be able to be
in charge of her own life.</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>E</font></font><font color="#CC0000">veryone
instantly knew that the witch had uttered a great truth and that Arthur's
life would be spared. And so it went. The neighboring monarch spared Arthur's
life and granted him total freedom.</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>W</font></font><font color="#CC0000">hat
a wedding Gawain and the witch had! Arthur was torn between relief and
anguish. Gawain was proper as always, gentle and courteous. The old witch
put her worst manners on display. She ate with her hands, belched and farted,
and made everyone uncomfortable. The wedding night approached:</font>
<br><font color="#CC0000">Gawain, steeling himself for a horrific night,
entered the bedroom.</font>

a sight awaited! The most beautiful woman he'd ever seen lay before him!
Gawain was astounded and asked what had happened. The beauty replied that
since he had been so kind to her (when she'd been a witch), half the time
she would be her horrible, deformed self, and the other half, she would
be her beautiful maiden self. Which would he want her to be during the
day and which during the night?</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>W</font></font><font color="#CC0000">hat
a cruel question? Gawain began to think of his predicament:</font>

the day a beautiful woman to show off to his friend, but at night, in the
privacy of his home, an old spooky witch? Or would he prefer having by
day a hideous witch, but by night a beautiful woman to enjoy many intimate
moments? What would you do? What Gawain chose follows below, but <b><u>don't

Gawain replied that he would let her choose for herself. Upon hearing this,
she announced that she would be beautiful all the time, because he had
respected her and had let her be in charge of her own life.</font>
