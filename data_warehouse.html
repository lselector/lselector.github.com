<p>One of the difficulties of querying a normalized database is in the
  big number of tables you may need to join sequentially in one query.&nbsp;
  You can easily have to chain 10 and more tables.&nbsp; This is difficult
  for a user (he must know his tables really well), and it may have very
  poor performance. Or even crash the database.
<p><center>
    <img SRC="images/tables.gif" height=71 width=482>
  </center>
  The common approach to resolve this problem is to try to restructure the
  data. You denormalize your tables. You also restructure them into so-called
  <b><font color="#FF0000">"star"-configuration</font></b> to avoid long chains.&nbsp; This means that you create one big&nbsp; <b><font color="#FF0000">"facts"
  table</font></b> (the center of the star) surrounded by 10-15 <b><font color="#FF0000">"dimension"
  tables</font></b>.&nbsp; This way you avoid long chains. Then you basically
  query one central <b><font color="#FF0000">"fact" table</font></b> - and
  narrow your scope by joining it with some <b><font color="#FF0000">"dimension"
  tables</font></b>.&nbsp; Your chain length =1. Sometimes you may add extra
  2-nd layer (chain length=2 - details) - this is called the Snowflake configuration
  - see images: <br>

<p>The <span class="style1">Star Schema</span> is  also known as a &quot;<span class="style1">star-join schema</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class="style1">data cube</span>&quot;, and &quot;<span class="style1">multidimensional schema</span>&quot;. </p>
<p>The main benefit of Star schema configuration is that it makes 
  easy for users to to make reports/queries, 
  especially implementing multi-dimensional views of data 
with different granularity for different dimensions. The applications (reports) become simplier and easier to understand for the user.
<ul>
  <li><b><font color="#FF0000">Fact table</font></b> - usually contains "facts"
    of events involving dimensions. For example, a purchase may be considered
    as a fact, which is characterized by many dimensions (time, store, product,
    promotion, etc.).&nbsp; Thus a row in a fact table corresponding to one
  purchase will have foreign keys to all corresponding dimension tables. The fact table stores the data at the lowest level of granularity, for example, for time dimansion the granularity may be - seconds. The other levels  of granularity (hour, day, week, month,...) are stored in corresponding &quot;dimension&quot; table.</li>
  <li><b><font color="#FF0000">Dimensions</font></b> - constitute the majority
    of objects in your database. They are typically something by which you
    would break your data into groups. For example, you could break your data
  by time (min, hour, day, week, month, quater, year), by store (store, zip, city, state, country), by product (...), by promotion (...), etc. The multiple levels of granularity (for time - hour, day, week, month ,...) are stored in corresponding dimension table.</li>
  <li><b><font color="#FF0000">Details</font></b> (for example 2nd layer
    in the Snowflake) - some details associated with dimensions, separated
    into separate tables. This make sense if these details not very important
    (not required very frequently). </li>
</ul>
<p>To optimize queries, it is necessary to create corresponding indexes. For example, for a report using data from 4 dimensions (d1,d2,d3,d4) you may use the following index:</p>
<p class="style2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;create index i1 on MyFactTable (id_d1, id_d2, id_d3, id_d4) </p>
<p>Database servers may have  special built-in optimizations to perform a query on a star schema. For example, in Oracle you can set <span class="style1">STAR_TRANSFORMATION_ENABLED=TRUE</span> and create bitmap indexes on keys in the fact table.</p>
<p>Fact table is usually very big (tens  of millions of rows - and larger) and gets more and more new data on a daily basis. It make sense to partition it by some time interval, for example by a month or quater of the year. To do this you need to add a column to the fact table (for example, month) by which you will do the  partitionning. </p>
<p>There are ways to bulk-load data in parallel - methods are different depending on the database brand (DB2, Oracle, ...). For example, for speed you can disable indexes and logging while doing the load - and then recreate the indexes after the load. Note - as rebuilding of an index for a big table takes a lot of time, there are ways to speed up this as well (partition the index, thus rebuilding index locally, use parallel calculations, turn off logging while rebuilding the index).</p>

<p><span class="style1">Data mart</span> is usually a set of partiular data designed to meet some specific knowledge needs. It may be one set of tables in <font color="#FF0000">Star</font> or <font color="#FF0000">Snowflake</font>
configuration. But may be something else. A big database with thousands of tables can be represented (for analysis)
  by tens of Data Marts.  
  Together these <b><font color="#FF0000">Data Marts</font></b> constitute
  a <b><font color="#FF0000">"Data Warehouse"</font></b>.

- 4 dimensions:&nbsp; stores, time periods, products, measures.
<br>
Thus data relationships can not be fit in a 2-dimentional table. It
is more like a multi-dimensional cube (<b><font color="#FF0000">hyper-cube</font></b>).
<br>You can slice this cube in different directions - and show a 2-dimensional
slice (or 3-dimensional picture).
<br>Note, that some of cube dimensions correspond to Dimensions of the
data mart (something you would group by - stores, time periods, products),
whereas others may be calculated measures (total, average, etc.).
<br>Each dimension usually has some <b><font color="#FF0000">hierarchy</font></b>
- <b><font color="#FF0000">multiple levels of granularity</font></b> (for
example for time: hour, day, week, month, etc.).
<p>The OLAP existed for ~30 years, but the term <b>OLAP</b> (On-Line Analytical
Processing) was introduced only in 1993 by Dr. Codd et al. in paper "Providing
OLAP to User-Analysts: An IT Mandate".&nbsp; Yes, the same Codd who formulated
database principles in 70s. The work was sponsored by Arbor Software, the
creators of ESSBASE.
<p>OLAP calculations should be fast (under 30 seconds).
<p><b>ROLAP</b> - analysis system based on Relational database.
<br><b>MOLAP</b> - analysis system using multidimensional database (much
faster).
<br><b>HOLAP</b> - Hybrid OLAP.

<br>Links.
<p>When designing your model, adding hierarchies takes less computer resources
than adding dimensions.
