<h1>
Apache JServ Status</h1></center>

<h3>
Introduction</h3>
One interesting feature of Apache JServ is that its main class, JServ.java,
is a servlet! Yes, it may seem strange, but Apache JServ is able to execute
itself as a servlet to output runtime information such as configurations
and, in the future, enable remote administration and runtime data such
as load or number of servlets in use.
<p>The Apache JServ Status is a collection of dynamically generated web
pages that allow the administrator to have a direct idea of the status
of the system, on both the mod_jserv module and on each connected servlet
engine.
<h3>
Accessing the Apache JServ Status pages</h3>
The Apache JServ Status front page is enabled by default in the example
configurations shipped in the distribution and it's mapped to the URI named
<b>/jserv/</b> (note the trailing slash!) in your main web server space
(for most systems try <a href="http://127.0.0.1/jserv/">http://127.0.0.1:80/jserv/</a>
but the address and the port are highly dependent on your web server configurations).
<p>These pages give you the ability to check existing configurations remotely
and control the correct servlet engine behavior from a centralized information
system.
<p><b><i>Warning</i>:</b> even if the status pages are enabled in the sample
configuration files shipped with the distribution, you are strongly encouraged
to deny the access to this location on a production environment since this
may give untrusted users the ability to gather important system security
information.
<h3>
Customizing the access to the Apache JServ Status pages</h3>
Here it's shown a general list of web server directives that can be used
to map the Apache JServ status pages to a particular location. These are
the directives used by the Apache Web Server and may be placed in any of
the three configuration files.
<blockquote>
<pre>&lt;Location /status/jserv/>
&nbsp; SetHandler jserv-status
&nbsp; order deny,allow
&nbsp; deny from all
&nbsp; allow from dummy.org
&lt;/Location></pre>
</blockquote>
The above directives map the Apache JServ status pages (SetHandler jserv-status)
to the URI /status/jserv/ (&lt;location /status/jserv/>) allowing the access
only from requests coming from the "dummy.org" domain.
<p>For more complex examples and documentation on how to restrict access
to a particular URI see the web server documents.
<h3>
Removing the Apache JServ Status pages</h3>
Removing these page is just a matter of removing the above directives from
the web server configuration files.
