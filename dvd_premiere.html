<p>Adobe takes some time to get used to - but it is time well spent, because it 
  is by far the best software to capture video (from your camera into the computer), 
  to do all the editing (from amateur to pro level) and output in different formats 
  (including mpeg encoding). 
<p>This short help is for version 7 (Adobe Premier Pro). Note, that it differs 
  from version 6.5 in many aspects. So even if you had prior experience, you will 
  have to spend some time getting used to it. First, Adobe Pro only wokrs on Windows 
  XP. No Windows 2000 or Mac !! There is no A/B editing (alas). The video transition 
  can now be applied on any video track, but only between 2 clips on the same 
  track. You can now have more than one sequence in the timeline window !! The 
  sequences are also listed with clips in a project window - and you can nest 
  (insert) one sequence into another by just dragging it into it (same was as 
  you drag clips).

<p>Turn on your mini DV camcorder and connect it to your computer using iLink 
              (firewire = IEEE 1394) cable. Start Adobe Premier. Create new project. 
              Select one of the 1st two standard project settings - Standard 32 
              kHz (12/16 bit audio) or standard 48 bit (16 bit audio). Note: you 
              should find out in which format the original movie was recorded 
              on your digital camera - and use the same format for capturing. 
              For my small Sony default is 12 bit audio - so I select the very 
              first setting (32 kHz Standard). 
            <p> <strong> Exploring Premiere Windows:</strong> 
            <p>Main Window can contain many other windows (Project, Effects, &quot;Effect 
              Controls&quot;, Monitor, Timelines for sequences, Tools, History, 
              Info, Audio mixer). Most of these windows can be opened from the 
              Windows menu. Timeline windows for different sequences can be opened 
              by double-clicking the corresponding sequence in the project window. 
            <p><strong>Project window (right top)</strong> - will contain all 
              video, audio clips and graphics from which we will make our movie. 
              You usually get them there either by right-clicking - and selecting 
              &quot;Import&quot; - or by capturing from your camera (choose <strong>File 
              &gt; Capture</strong>). You can organize all your assets into bins 
              (folders) - this makes sense when you have many of them. The list 
              will also contain your first sequence (timeline). Double click it 
              to open a timeline window with this sequence. The project window 
              may have two more tabs: <strong>&quot;Effects&quot;</strong> and 
              <strong>&quot;Effect Controls&quot;</strong>. Most commonly used 
              are video and audio transitions (like cross-disolve between two 
              adjacent clips). 
            <p><strong>Timeline window(s)</strong> - the main window where you 
              assemble your movie. Drag and drop clips from Project window to 
              the timeline. Move, trim, adjust the pieces in the timeline. Press 
              SPACE or Enter to play the movie (Enter does rendering). You can 
              preview the movie in the <strong>Monitor Window</strong>. </td>

            <p>Select <strong>File &gt; Capture ...</strong> - and use capture 
              window to record the video into a file. The window allows to capture 
              Audio and Video, or just Audio or just Video. This window takes 
              over control of your digital camera. You can play back, rewind, 
              use shuttle to move back/forward, move by single frame, capture 
              (<strong>red button</strong>) and stop (just hit Escape). Once you 
              stopped recording - you will be prompted to save the file. After 
              that your clip is in the bin. You can now double click on it - and 
              a separate clip window will pop-up so that you can play the clip. 
              Use it to specify exact <strong>IN and OUT points</strong> (trim 
              the clip). You can move back and forth - even by single frames - 
              and then press on curlies (<strong> { } </strong>) where you want 
              IN or OUT. You can then move curlies manually. Adobe Premier will 
              use only the piece between the curlies in the timeline. This is 
              how the trimming is done (later you can also change the trimming 
              right in the timeline). Close the clip window. You can trim one 
              piece of the clip - and put it on the timeline. Then you can select 
              another piece - and put it on the timeline too. 
            <p>OK, now if you drag and drop this clip (and other clips) from Project 
              window to the <strong>Timeline</strong> window - you can do arranging/editing 
              - and play the whole movie from any moment by pressing the play 
              button in the <strong>Reference Monitor</strong> window. </td>

<p><strong>Monitor</strong> window has many convenient controls. Explore them 
              by holding the mouse above each one of them - and reading the tool 
              tips help. You can set <strong>IN</strong> and <strong>OUT</strong> 
              points by pressing curlies (<strong> { } </strong>). You can play 
              and stop the movie, move forward and back by single frame, or using 
              Jog disk or Shuttle slider. You can jump from marker to marker, 
              play between IN and OUT points. You can change magnification and 
              quality of the display. You can even switch from video to showing 
              video's luminance or colors, etc. 
            <p>The Monitor also allows you to insert video or/and audio from one 
              place into another (so called <strong>&quot;3-point and 4-point 
              editing&quot;</strong>). When you have monitor in Dual-view mode 
              - you see 2 screens:<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Left screen - also called &quot;<strong>Source 
              monitor</strong>&quot;. You put clips there by double-clicking the 
              clips in the project window (or dragging them from Project window). 
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Right screen - also called &quot;<strong>Program 
              monitor</strong>&quot;. It shows movie from the timeline. 
            <p> Note the three icons on the bottom-right of the panels. On the 
              Program panel (right) the arrows are pointing up (lift and extract), 
              and the 3rd button is for trimming. On the Source monitor (left) 
              the arrows are pointing down (insert and overlay), and the 3rd button 
              selects if you want to do both Video and Audio - or just one of 
              them. 
            <p>The idea is that you select the source and select the piece of 
              it using curlies { }. Then you specify the target tracks by clicking 
              the track header area of the Timeline window (where track names 
              are located - the <font color="#0000FF"><strong>target tracks will 
              appear darker than the other tracks and will have curved outer corners</strong></font>). 
              Position the CTI (Current Time Indicator) on the timeline (or Program 
              monitor) at the point where you want to do the insert. Now drag 
              from Source to Program screen to do overlay edit (or Ctrl-drag for 
              insert edit). Instead of dragging you can also simply press the 
              insert or overlay buttons on the panel (or use keyboard shortcuts). 
            <p>Note, that you can also do the same editing (insert, overlay) by 
              simply dragging the clips in the timeline. You can do it on one 
              track - or on several (then the clip on the highest track wins.

                15 frames more from the right clip. preserving other clips' positions 
                in time and maintaining the total duration of the sequence. Press 
                <strong>Alt</strong> to make a split edit (to do Video separately

                video and audio) into two separate clips</li>
              <li><strong>Slide</strong> tool - to shift a clip in time while 
                trimming adjacent clips to compensate for the move. As you drag 
                a clip left or right with the slide tool, the Out point of the 
                preceding clip and the In point of the following clip are trimmed 
                by the number of frames you move the clip. The clip's In and Out

                }</strong> - and drag the piece to the timeline. Do the same for 
                other pieces.</li>
              <li>You can create several sequences - they will be listed in the 
                project window with all the clips.</li>
              <li>You can nest one sequence inside another. Just drag the first 
                sequence from the project window into the second window the same 
                way you would drag a clip. Or, if you need to use just part of 
                the sequence - drag it into the monitor window, set IN and OUT 
                points (<strong>{ }</strong>) - and then edit it into the second 
                sequence.</li>
              <li>If you want to cut a piece from the middle of a clip - use Razor 
                tool (make two cuts - and delete the middle), or use the extract 
                command (extract button on the Program monitor).</li>
              <li>If you want to overlap several tracks - change the transparency 
                of the tracks starting from the top one (<strong>Effect Controls 
                &gt; Opacity</strong>). You can also set several opacity handlers 
                inside a clip - and adjust opacity making it different in different 
                parts of the clip. </li>
              <li>You can create very sophisticated <strong>titles</strong> (choose 
                <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Title</strong>), including rolling 
                or scrolling horizontally or vertically. </li>
              <li><strong>Audio</strong> recording - you can record your voice 
                (or music) right into Adobe Premier Pro - open <strong>Audio Mixer</strong> 
                Window. Then you can adjust the volume (show volume in the audio 
                clip, set several handlers inside the clip - and adjust the volume 
                differently for differnt parts of the clip. You can also change 
                balance for stereo clips - and also apply audio efects (including 
                digital filtering).</li>
              <li>You can set markers (sequence markers and clip markers) - just 
                position the time cursor (Current Time Indicator = <strong>CTI</strong>) 
                where you want to place the marker - and use the Marker menu. 
                You can then jump from marker to marker (using the same menu or 
                pressing Ctrl-RightArrow or Ctrl-LeftArrow ...). Sequence markers 
                can be named and used as chapter points in Adobe DVD Encore when 
                creating a DVD.</li>
              <li> If you messed up your windows - Choose <strong>Windows &gt; 
                Workspace &gt; Editing</strong> (or some other choice) - and windows 
                will be arranged in one of standard ways. If you closed your timeline 
                window - open it by double-clicking its name in the project window.</li>
              <li>It is a good idea to save the project every 10 min. </li>
              <li>When creating graphics in external applications (Adobe Photoshop) 
                - use NTSC safe colors.</li>
              <li>Use safe areas correctly: 
                <ul>
                  <li>Safe Title Zone - will be displayed on all televisions</li>
                  <li>Safe Action Area - will most probably be displayed on nearly 
                    all televisions.</li>
                </ul>

<p>Why 29.97 frames per second (fpc) ? Orginal NTSC was 525 lines and 30 fpc, 
              and PAL - 625 lines and 25 fpc. To accomodate color, the decision 
              was made to make some room for that at the expence of frames (NTSC 
              code skips couple frames at the beginning of every minute) - that's 
              why NTSC now has 29.97 fpc .</p>
            <p>Timecode: hh:mm:ss:ff, where ff - frame number (from 00 to 29).</p>
            <p>Standard VHS - 250 lines resolution, S-VHS -400 lines, Betacam-SP 
              - 340 lines.</p>
            <p>Standard aspect ratios are 4:3 for normal screen, and 16:9 for 
              wide screen. <br>
              Standard 15&quot; computer screen has 4:3 aspect ration (12&quot; 
              wide and 9&quot; high (12:9 = 4:3)). <br>
              Standard computer screen has square pixels: (1024:768 = 4/3).<br>
              Standard photograph also has 4:3 aspect ratio. </p>
            <p>But for miniDV - 720x480 pixels = 3:2. </p>
            <p>A perfect circle in the picture imported into your movie will look 
              like vertically stretched ellipse on the TV screen. This is because 
              the pixels on a computer screen are square, but on TV screen they 
              are rectangular (stretched). If you start with an image which has 
              perfect aspect ratio of 4:3 (for example 1024x768) - and you want 
              to import it into Premiere project which is in NTSC DV (720x480), 
              you should resize it to 720x480. It will look as it is compressed 
              vertically. But then after you will import it into Adobe Premiere 
              - it will look normal again. By the way, Premiere shows video on 
              computer screen scaled 4:3 as if it were on TV (take a tape measure 
              and measure yourself).</p>

<p>Transition is something you insert on the point where one clip 
              ends and another starts. For example, you can use a cross-disolve 
              to smoothen things up. Or you can use some other transition, like 
              &quot;Page Peel&quot;, or &quot;Iris&quot; or 3D motion, Wipe, Zoom, 
              etc. - Adobe Premiere Pro comes with 73 different transitions. </p>
            <p>You select a transition from the Project Window &gt; Effects &gt; 
              Video Transitions - and drag it to the track. The transition can 
              only be made between two clips on the same track. The transition 
              needs some extra frames - they usually are available if you trim 
              the clip. If not - the warning pop=up will be shown and the last 
              frame will be repeated. You can adjust the properties of the transition 
              in the Monitor Window &gt; Effect Controls. When you create a transition 
              - a red bar appears above it in the timeline. If the transition 
              doesn't show correctly in the monitor - you may need to render the 
              sequence (select it - and press &quot;ENTER&quot;) - or do Alt-drag 
              of the CTI (Current Time Indicator) to preview correctly.</p>
            <p>Similarly you can create audio transitions (Project Window &gt; 
              Effects &gt; Audio Transitions). </p>

<p>I usually make mpeg clips in MPEG-1 format, because this format can be played 
  by all major players: Windows Media Player, QuickTime Player, and RealOne Player. 
  Here is what I do:
<p><strong>File &gt; Export &gt; Adobe Media Encoder ...</strong> - and then select 
  format &quot;<strong>MPEG-1</strong>&quot; and select one of the presets. Once 
  you set everything first time - you will be given an option to save this as 
  a preset - so next time jsut select a preset.
<p>Here are the presets I use:
<table width="95%" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#FF00FF">

            <ul>
              <li>Set Width/Height frame size to 300/200 pixels. This is because 
                I start with NTSC DV 720/480 = 3/2. Most players will understand 
                it and play the movie at the actual geometrical size ratio is 
                4/3. Note: if you try to change the size to 320/240 (=4/3) - then 
                the movie will look vertically compressed in video players.</li>
              <li>Aspect ratio - just leave it at NTSC setting 1.095. Don't change 
                it to 1.</li>
              <li>Bitrate (Mbps) - set to ~0.8 Mbps by sliding the sliding control. 
                The actual number will be something like 0.8030. Note: do NOT 
                enter this number by hand. Use slider. Note: This bitrate will 
                define file size of the file as ~100 KB per 1 second of the clip. 
                If you make bitrate too small - the movie gets &quot;jerky&quot;.</li>
              <li>Set Quality to 4 (or even smaller) using the slide control. 
                Note: The quality setting doesn't effect the final size of the 
                file (it is defined by the bitrate). If the quality is set unnecesary 
                high - then it will take longer to make an MPG file.</li>
