virtual memory, shared libraries, demand loading, proper memory management,
TCP/IP
networking, and other features consistent with Unix-type systems. It has
reliability of Unix systems, you can customize it to your task (it is open).&nbsp;
Plus you get tonns of software packages for free (office software, programming
tools, graphics, and anything and everything else, including even the Windows
system looking very similar to Microsoft Windows, even including the "Start"

<p><b><font color="#990000">Linux's Forgotten Man</font></b>
<br><font color="#990000">by Leander Kahney</font>
<p><font color="#990000">12:00 p.m.&nbsp; 5.Mar.99.PST</font>
<br><font color="#990000">SAN JOSE, California - You have to feel for Richard
Stallman.</font>
<br><font color="#990000">Like a Russian revolutionary erased from a photograph,
he is being written out of history. Stallman is the originator of the free-software
movement and the GNU/Linux operating system. But you wouldn't know it from
reading about LinuxWorld. Linus Torvalds got all the ink.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">Even the name of the operating system, to which
Torvalds contributed a small but essential part, acknowledges Torvalds
alone: the Stallman part - the GNU before Linux - is almost always left
out.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">It makes Stallman mad. At a press conference during
the show, one unlucky journalist thoughtlessly called it Linux and got
an earful for his mistake.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">With a mane of long black hair and a Rasputin-like
beard, Stallman looks like a wild man. He carries his possessions in plastic
bags. In one hand, a bag is crammed with boxes of tea. In the other, he
clutches his traveling kit, which includes a battered laptop.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">The computer isn't Stallman's. It belongs to the
Free Software Foundation, of which he is the founder. Stallman, a programmer
who has won a MacArthur Foundation genius award, has never owned his own
computer. The loaner runs free software - he has never used Windows.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">Nor does Stallman have a car, a TV, or a mortgage.
By his own admission, the 46-year-old bachelor lives frugally in a rented
room in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He hasn't had a full-time job in 15 years.
The little work he does costs his clients an arm and a leg. "I'm working
to make software free and make computers free. That's my job," he declares.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">Work is also the reason Stallman doesn't want
kids. He refuses to dedicate the time to making enough money to raise them.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">"I've got more important things to do with my
life," he says. "I've a mission that needs work."</font>
<p><font color="#990000">That mission began in the early 1980s while working
at the Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT. He began stitching together
his own Unix-like operating system, which he called GNU, a recursive acronym
for "GNU's Not Unix."</font>
<p><font color="#990000">He took bits and pieces from different sources
and covered the growing system with a new license called the GNU General
Public License, known as "copyleft." This unique license allows the software
to be freely copied, modified, and distributed. It is the foundation of
the free-software movement.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">In the mid-'80s, Stallman resigned from MIT to
prevent the institute from laying claim to the growing GNU project.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">However, the system lacked an essential component:
the kernel, or underpinnings, of the operating system that communicates
with hardware. In the early '90s, a young Finnish programmer named Linus
Torvalds created one, combined it with the GNU system, and posted the result
on the Internet. It was called Linux, a name that stuck.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">"They put it together and called it Linux without
acknowledging the work that came before," says Stallman. "I think it's
unfair to call our work by someone else's name."</font>
<p><font color="#990000">While Stallman concedes that Torvald's contribution
was essential, he estimates that the kernel represents only about 3 percent
of the entire system. In contrast, the GNU project contributed about 30
percent of the code, while the remaining 67 percent was taken from other
sources, he says.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">The problem with being co-opted, Stallman says,
is not one of personal glory, but that most people talking about the system
are not talking about issues of freedom.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">"I want these ideas to get the publicity. I think
it's a damn shame that all the publicity is going to someone who doesn't
advocate these ideas of freedom."</font>
<p><font color="#990000">That someone, of course, is Torvalds. But is there
not a hint of acrimony? Does he not wish he were getting more recognition?</font>
<p><font color="#990000">"I hope not. But how can I know for sure? I've
got an ego like everyone else. I'm sure my ego wants me to be more famous.
I don't know."</font>
<p><font color="#990000">In a nutshell, Stallman believes that software
must be free, not necessarily available for nothing, but free to be copied,
modified, distributed, shared, and fixed.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">"I'm not against commercial anything," Stallman
said. "I'm against proprietary software that divides and conquers the users."</font>
<p><font color="#990000">Unlike commercial software, which is proprietary,
free-software programmers don't have to solve the same problems over and
over. They keep improving on the work that came before, like the scientific
method.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">However, in Stallman's eyes, the programming community
is more interested in talking about practical issues, like performance
- an anathema to Stallman.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">And this conflict is partly why Stallman is marginalized.
Most people don't want to talk about freedom. There's been a splintering
of the movement: away from free software created by ideologues to open-source
software created by business-friendly pragmatists like Torvalds.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">"[Torvalds] is basically an engineer," Stallman
said. "He likes free software, but isn't concerned with issues of freedom.
That's why I'm unhappy when the GNU system is called Linux.... People are
no longer exposed to the philosophical views of the GNU project."</font>
<p><font color="#990000">Does nomenclature matter to the geeks on the show
floor? A number of showgoers say they felt in their hearts the correct
name was GNU/Linux, but it was easier just to call it Linux.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">"I recognize it as GNU/Linux but I don't call
it GNU/Linux because I'm lazy," says one attendee. "I agree that Stallman
didn't get the recognition he deserves, but that's partly because of his
abrasive personality."</font>

<p><font color="#000000">The varied personalities of Linux definitely show
the many facets that make up our favorite OS. I was reading the Wired article
that had an interview with RMS, and I've seen quite a few interviews with
Linus. IMHO, Stallman represents quite a bit of what Linux and it's users
is all about, but Torvalds is more a way to market it.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Obviously both Torvalds and Stallman were and
are central to the OS. As we all know, the kernel mainly the product of
Linus, but most of the tools, and the very license under which Linux was
placed is the result of Stallman's GNU. But, these two men don't seem to
get along quite as well as the software they wrote. Linux is a coder, but
RMS is a zealot.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Stallman's fire, passion, and concern for politics
are essential for Linux users. Many people criticize Richard for being
overly paranoid, but that paranoia is necessary, especially in the upcoming
months and years. As Linux gains mainstream support, there will undoubtedly
be blatant violations of the GPL. Slashdot has recently posted at least
one story of a new distro that violates the GPL. It's a huge asset to have
RMS and similar enthusiasts to vigorously defend the freedom that our "rebel"
OS has come to represent.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">As a result, I love having RMS go everywhere he
can, reminding people of the free nature of Linux. Excuse me, GNU/Linux.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Remind people that Linus didn't write the whole
kernel, and owns a very small percentage of the code in any Linux distro.
Torvalds will be the first to admit that. And Stallman reminds us that
Linux is more about hackers and free code than about the OS itself. It's
about making decisions for ourselves, not having to accept a crappy OS.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">But as much credit as RMS deserves, he shouldn't
necessarily be the spokesman for Linux. While</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Stallman looks like a fanatic, Linus is like the
penguins; cute, maybe a little plump, but over all, someone who's very
likeable. Plus he has a "normal" job, and is making money from Linux (not
directly, but through his Transmeta job, speaking, etc.)</font>
<p><font color="#000000">As a result, though Stallman deserves tons of
credit, he shouldn't necessarily be on the cover of the magazines. He's
done a great job, as has Linus, but as Linux gets marketed to a more mainstream
audience, we need to look at our figurehead. Stallman ranting to Wired
is great, it gets everyone to stop, think, and be more aware of the politics.
But let's think twice before flaming CNN/Fortune if their latest Newstand
didn't mention RMS. We all know of his contribution, and all geeks appreciate
it. We need him to help lead the movement, but not necessarily to be our
public leader. Let CNN snub him, and let the other mags ignore him. He
has a great product to be proud of. But as great as he is, he's often inflammatory,
nearly always an extremist, and not necessarily who the business community
wants to put it's trust in.</font>
