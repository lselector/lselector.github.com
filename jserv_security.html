How to secure your servlet environment</h1></center>

<h3>
Introduction</h3>
In this section, you will learn how to secure your servlet engine in a
variety of different situations. This howto is an introduction to the security
issues involved with Apache JServ.
<h3>
External security</h3>
Apache JServ 1.0 has introduced important enhancements on the communication
protocol to reduce the risks of untrusted servlet execution. Let's make
an example so that you get the idea of the problem. Let us suppose you
have a free-form SQL query servlets connected to your precious database.
This servlet is for remote administration and database debugging purposes
and it's secured by any means on the web server side.
<p>If no security restrictions were available on the servlet engine side,
a wise and knowledge attacker might request that servlet directly to the
servlet engine, thus bypassing web server security. This is called an external
attack.
<p>To prevent external attacks Apache JServ 1.0 introduced new powerful
security restrictions: an IP filter for incoming connections and an MD5-based
connection authentication scheme.
<h3>
IP filtering</h3>
The most simple and effective way of reducing the risk of external attacks
is to filter incoming requests based on the IP address of the client. Note
that this doesn't affect the wide audience of the web server because only
web servers should be allow to connect to the servlet engine. For this
reason, to enable connections from a particular IP address you must specify
it in the allowed list in the main Apache JServ configuration file.
<p>For example, if you have two web servers that make requests using 194.39.283.233
and 194.39.283.234 and wish to restrict the servlet requests only from
those addresses you add the following line to your <i>jserv.properties</i>
file
<blockquote>
<pre>security.allowedAddresses=194.39.283.233,194.39.283.234</pre>
</blockquote>
With this filter enabled, any connection coming on the port Apache JServ
is listening to from an IP address not contained in the list, is automatically
ignored.
<h3>
Connection authentication</h3>
In the rare cases where IP filtering is not enough, for example when untrusted
users may generate requests from the allowed IP address, authentication
connection can be used to reduce to a minimum the chance of external attack.
To do this, both the web server and the servlet engine must have a binary
copy of the same file, any file, that is called <i>secret key</i>.
<p>This file may have any format and any length (could even be an image!),
but we suggest you to create your own text file monkey-typing around a
hundred bytes. After a few dozens of bytes, the security improvement is
negligible while the time taken by the authentication procedure is linear
with the secret key length. For this reason there is very little need for
long secret keys.
<p>Note: your security is strictly related to that secret key file. Anybody
that can guess or recreate your secret key is a potential external attacker
if his requests come from the correct IP addresses. It is not needed to
suggest you to protect your secret key files and make them not readable
or writable to untrusted users.
<p>To enable the authentication on the servlet engine side you should add
these two lines to your <i>jserv.properties</i> file
<blockquote>
<pre>security.authentication=false
security.secretKey=/etc/jserv/jserv.secret.key</pre>
</blockquote>
Then you have to enable authentication on every web server that connects
to that servlet engine adding this line to your <i>httpd.conf</i> files
<blockquote>
<pre>ApJServSecretKey /etc/jserv/jserv.secret.key</pre>
</blockquote>
Make sure the two secret key files are even the same or the exact binary
copy, and both the web server and the servlet engine have permissions to
read them.
<h3>
Internal security</h3>
While external security is the matter of restricting untrusted servlet
execution, internal security deals with securing systems from dangerous
servlet behavior. If you build your own servlets or have full control over
them (having the source code) you don't need any more internal security.
Things get different if you use precompiled servlets you don't trust like
in the case of ISP's providing servlet environments for third parties.
<p>Like the ability of running CGI with different UID/GID, on possible
solution for internal security is to have different instances of the servlet
engine running with different UID/GID. This allows complete separation
of the servlets served by the different servlet engine instances.
<p>Another possibility, that will be implemented in the future, is the
use of more complex Java security managers to protect system resources
from unwanted servlet behavior. This will be implemented in future releases.
