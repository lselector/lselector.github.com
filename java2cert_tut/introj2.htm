<h3>
The purpose of this tutorial</h3>
These pages are designed to help you pass the Sun Certified Java Programmers
Exam. I have attempted to lay out the pages so they print out acceptably
on A4 paper. It has been under active development for more than a year
and incorporates feedback and corrections from many hundreds of people
(thank you all). It is only available in this form, ie discreet web pages.
There is no single file download because of the additional work it would
take to keep such a file updated.&nbsp;
<p>You can search through the entire site including this tutorial from
the search field at the front of this site. Although I cover all of the
objectives as published by Sun, other topics may come up on the exam. Two
that I know of are are I/O and the graphics paint method..
<p>This tutorial is designed mainly for final cramming rather than in-depth
study and learning. It assumes that you already know the basic principles
of programming from a language such as C/C++ or Visual Basic and that you
can set up your Java environment to create and run Java programs. It doesn't
try to make you a good programmer, or even a good Java programmer, it just
tries to get you through the exam by concentrating narrowly on the objectives.&nbsp;
<p>It assumes that you know stuff like the difference between an application
and an applet and that Java is case sensitive. If you don't know this type
of stuff, get hold of a beginners Java tutorial and play with the language
to get some understanding. You could do worse that going to the Sun web
site and downloading the Sun Java Tutorial at <a href="http://www.javasoft.com/docs/books/tutorial/index.html">http://www.javasoft.com/docs/books/tutorial/index.html</a>
<p>Another handy online Java Tutorial can be found at <a href="http://www.phrantic.com/scoop/onjava.html">http://www.phrantic.com/scoop/onjava.html</a>.
Two other books for beginning Java programmers are Peter van der Lindens
Just Java And Beyond and the O’Reilly Java In a Nutshell Deluxe Edition
which comes with the Nutshell book plus the text on a CD ROM and the text
of 4 other books on the CD ROM.&nbsp;
<h3>
<b>Can't afford the Technical Books?</b></h3>
If you find Technical books are not affordable, you you may like to check
out the links I am putting in to free tutorial information on the net.
These are generally web sites, but one is the excellent book by Bruce Eckel
"Thinking in Java". This is freely downloadable and is an excellent general
Java book. See <a href="http://www.bruceeckel.com/">http://www.bruceeckel.com</a>
for the links. If you have an unreliable internet link and find that large
downloads like the JDK tend to break half way through then you may benefit
from a program like GoZilla, from <a href="http://www.gizmo.net/gozilla">http://www.gizmo.net/gozilla.</a>
You can find the Java Glossary and a huge amount of excellent links organised
by the unique Roedy Green at <a href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss.html">http://mindprod.com/jgloss.html</a>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>For the final arbiter on the Java language check out the Java Language
Specification, sometimes called the JLS. This can answer the really tricky
questions and the sneaky ones like "is null a keyword".You can find the
JLS at
<p><a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/jTOC.doc.html">http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/jTOC.doc.html</a>
<h3>
Subjects not covered by the exam</h3>
As you will see from reading the objectives the topics of the exam are
limited to the basics of the Java language. In case you are concerned to
find what is not on the exam, take a look at the document at.
<p><a href="http://www.software.u-net.com/javaexam/NotCovered.htm">http://www.software.u-net.com/javaexam/NotCovered.htm</a>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>You can see the first version of this document written for the objectives
published for the JDK 1.1 exam at
<p><a href="http://www.jchq.net/J2Tutor/IntroJ2.htm">http://www.software.u-net.com/</a>
<h3>
