<h2>11) The java.io package </h2>



<h2>Objective 3)</h2>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Distinguish between conditions under 

  which platform default encoding conversion should be used and conditions under 

  which a specific conversion should be used. </font> </p>



<p>This could be a &quot;bondage and discipline&quot; type of objective. By this 

  I mean that some purists might take the attitude that you should always specify 

  the encoding conversion because you never know where, when and how your program 

  will be used. It was because so many programmers assumed that the code they 

  wrote that would never have to cope with the year 2,000 that there is such a 

  mess at the moment. Well it's a well paying mess for some programmers.<br>

  <br>

  <br>

  If you take a more benign view, this objective
asks you identify if your code 

  is likely to ever have to deal with anything
but the default encoding. If your 

  home default encoding is not ISO-LATIN-1
and you consider that English is the 

  international language of Business, or
you may need to deal with other character


  sets, then take advantage of the ability
to do specific conversions.<BR><BR>
If some of this means nothing to you, re-read
the previous section about the Reader and
Writer classes.</p>
