<p><b><font color="#CC0000">How to write your resume</font></b>
<p>The longer your resume - the better. Don't try to squeeze it in one
page.&nbsp; Good resume of experienced programmer may easily be 3-5 pages
long (I've seen longer).
<p>Don't play with fancy formatting in MS Word - plain text is good enough.
And it is easier to send over email or post on the Internet. And it may
be easier to scan (many companies scan resume into the computer - although
in my experience in last several years, resume is almost always delivered
electronically (email or web page)).
<p>Put your name and contact information right on the top. Don't forget
email and telephone. Keep all contact info in one place, because usually
agents will cut this header off and substitute it with contact information
of their agency.
<p>Then you may put the following info:
<p><b><u>Objective (optional):</u></b> - only if you want to state what
you want (or don't want) in your future job. Agents prefer to cut this
off because it narrows the marketability.
<p><b><u>Summary:</u></b> - this is the most important part of the resume.
Nobody reads the whole resume - but everybody reads the summary. So put
90% of your time into perfecting it. Imagine that a manager called your
agent and told him that he needs an experienced java programmer (at least
3 years) with unix, Oracle, and financial experience. In one phrase he
defined what he needs. Another example - imagine that you are asking a
manger if he may be willing to consider interviewing your friend. "What
kind of programmer is he?"&nbsp; "Well, he is a C++ programmer on Windows
platform."&nbsp; Again, in just one phrase you defined main features.&nbsp;
This is exactly what you should do in summary - in a short telegraphic
bulleted style define your major qualifying points: how many years of experience
you have, what main languages, databases, frameworks.&nbsp; Try to include
the skills and key-words which are in demand on the market.
<p><b><u>Skills:</u></b> - list all your skills, subdivide them by topics,
for example:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; LANGUAGES:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; DATABASES:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; PLATFORMS:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; INTRA / INTERNET TECHNOLOGIES:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; XML/XSL TECHNOLOGIES:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; ENTERPRISE APPLICATION INTEGRATION:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; OTHER SKILLS:
<br>Remember, you are been hired as a tool (like a hammer). So manager
needs to know on which platforms you punched the keyboard, which tools
you used, etc. Be specific. List all (even small) utilities you used. Even
MS Office.
<p><b><u>Professional Experience:</u></b> - start with your current or
most recent job - and go back in time. For each job state when, where,
and in which capacity you worked. Then describe different projects you
worked on.&nbsp; For each project give brief definition - and mostly concentrate
on technologies used and your functions. Manager needs to know not just
that you were doing reports - but exactly - on which platform, using which
tools. Be specific about your practical skills.
<p><b><u>Education:</u></b> - list when, how long, major subjects, degree
earned
<p><b><u>References:</u></b> - available upon request.
<p>Below are some tips and instructions which I got from some agencies
- you may use them too:

<p>Think of your resume as your marketing brochure. Think of yourself as
a product with unique features and benefits, and the employer or recruiter
is a customer who needs this product. Your resume should be like a sales
tool, telling the reader why they should want to meet you for demonstration
of who you are.
<p>Use your resume just to get the interview. Don't go into detail about
every item on your resume. The purpose of your resume is to generate enough
interest in you to have an employer contact you for an interview. Again,
think sales brochure. No one has ever been hired because they had a really
detailed resume.
<p>Use bullet points. In the body of your resume, use bullets with short
sentences rather than lengthy paragraphs. Resumes are read quickly. This
bulleted sentence format makes it easier for someone to quickly scan your
resume and still absorb the contents.
<p>Use numbers, dollars, and percentages. Numbers, dollars, and percentages
stand out in the body of a resume and grab the reader's attention. Think
along the lines of number of people supervised, increased sales by $X amount
of dollars, decreased departments payroll budget by X% percentage points.
<p>Lead with your strengths. Since resumes are typically reviewed in less
than a minute, take the time to determine which bullet points most strongly
support the type of job you are applying for. Put those strong points first
where they are more apt to be read.
<p>Pump up the positive. Leave off negatives and irrelevant points off
of your resume. Stick to the point. Your accomplishments related to your
career history is what the reader is looking for. Irrelevant personal information
is not.&nbsp; You will not get an interview because you are a champion
clog dancer.
<p>Get your resume "out there." Think of getting your resume out as a numbers
game. The more the better. Apply for more jobs than less. Part of getting
your resume out there is combining all of the resources that are available
to you. Not only do you want to send your resume off to individual jobs
that you see on the jobboards or in the newspaper, but you want to post
your resume to as many resume databases as possible. Get your resume in
front of as many Search Firms as possible. Consider using a resume distribution
service, which will email your resume to 1000's of recruiters in your industry
for a small fee.

<p><b>How to write a resume (don't know the author):</b>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>Major Resume Components
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>HEADING: At the top of your resume should be your name, present (local)
address and/or permanent (home) address. Include apartment number and zip
code, and phone numbers with area codes. A daytime phone number is a must.
Include your e-mail address if you have one.
<br>Objective (optional): Use only if you are very clear about the job
you seek, otherwise, do not include one. State your objective clearly and
specifically in a phrase such as "drafting position in supervisory capacity
with manufacturer of mechanical or electrical products". It is possible
to have two or more resumes with different job objectives, or you may use
the cover letter accompanying your resume to state your career goals.
<br>Education: Degrees earned (or to be completed) should be listed in
reverse chronological order. Generally, you need not include high school
unless that is the extent of your formal education. For each degree give
the following:
<br>Name and location of school attended
<br>Degree, and (expected) year of graduation
<br>Major; minor or concentration if relevant
<br>Grade point average (optional)
<br>&nbsp;Research/thesis topic (if applicable)
<br>Relevant courses (optional)
<br>Scholarships, honors, awards (optional)
<br>Extracurricular activities (optional)
<br>&nbsp;
<p>TECHNICAL SKILLS
<br>Operating Systems: VAX/VMS, MS-DOS
<br>Hardware: Digital VAX 11/785, IBM PC-AT
<br>Software: ABT Project Workbench, Goldengate, Professional Write, XyWrite,
IBM Script, Lotus Freelance Plus
<p>Experience: Depending upon which format you choose, (see pp. 2, 3 and
4), organize your work experience either in reverse chronological order
or by functions and skills.
<br>Chronological. List your employment in reverse chronological order.
Give position held, employer, and dates of employment. Describe each position
according to job duties: list tasks performed, outcomes and achievements,
emphasizing those requiring the highest level of skill, responsibility
and i.e. judgment. Begin each phrase with action verbs (see p. 5). Quantify
and qualify your accomplishments, "surpassed sales quota by 15%", "trained
and supervised 5 employees", "maintained average case load of 85".
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Functional Combined. Group your work accomplishments, responsibilities,
and duties according to functional skill areas such as "Teaching and Training",
"Managerial Skills", "Sales". Choose skill headings that support your job
objective and briefly describe, using action statements, the work you did
in each of the broad categories you identify. For example, if you did financial
analysis and planning in previous positions, describe these responsibilities
under the heading "Financial Planning" and treat your experience in this
area as one complete unit. Your work history can be briefly listed in reverse
chronological order in a separate section.
<br>Other possible sections of the resume: The following information, although
not always required or necessary, may also be included in a resume.
<br>Professional certificates or licenses
<br>Special skills and abilities (including language facility)
<br>Publications
<br>Major accomplishments
<br>Selected achievements
<br>Summary of qualifications
<br>References
<br>&nbsp;Membership/affiliations
<br>Interests
<br>Additional training
<br>Military experience (if applicable)
<br>Professional and personal strengths
<br>Community service
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<p><b><u>Standard Resume Formats</u></b>
<p>The CHRONOLOGICAL format is the most widely used and accepted. Content
is laid out in reverse chronological order preferably with no gaps in time.
The format emphasizes major responsibilities and work experiences. The
strong points of this resume are that the format is one which most employers
prefer, is easiest to prepare, shows a steady employment history, and provides
the interviewer with a guide for discussion during the interview. Its limitations
are that it can starkly reveal gaps in employment history, it may put undesired
emphasis on certain experiences you may wish to minimize, and it may be
difficult to highlight your skills.
<p>The FUNCTIONAL COMBINED format is designed to highlight the qualifications
of the applicant with much less emphasis on specific work titles and dates.
Therefore, this format is suggested for those who have a diverse work history
or who are making a career change.
<p>The strong points of this resume are that it allows you to highlight
skills that are relevant to your job objective, minimizes gaps in time,
and can be varied to emphasize or de-emphasize work history and job titles.
The limitations of this resume are that it takes longer to prepare, can
be difficult to read unless it is well written. It may also be annoying
to employers who want to know what you did, where you did it, and when;
the facts are included but not emphasized.
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<p><b><u>Scannable Resumes</u></b>
<p>Many organizations are tracking applicants by scanning their resumes
into computer databases. These resumes are retrieved through key word searches
when openings occur.
<p>What gets the attention of a computer is different than what gets the
attention of a hiring manager. Scanable resumes are specifically designed
to be scanned and are not necessarily visually pleasing.
<p>We recommend that you call some of the companies you plan to send resumes
to and find out whether or not they use an electronic scanner. Below is
a list of helpful hints for your electronically scanned resumes.
<p>Use industry jargon.
<br>Nouns are better than verbs.
<br>A computer search will target key words specific to your profession.
<br>You need to use key words throughout your resume.
<br>Use white or off white paper.
<br>Avoid blues and grays because they minimize the contrast between the
letters and the background.
<br>Use 12 point type; using smaller type may confuse the scanner.
<br>Use standard 8 1/2 x 11 paper
<br>Do not fold the paper because words in the creases cannot be read easily
by a scanner.
<br>Avoid graphics, bolds, bullets, italics, underlining and fancy fonts
because they will not scan well.
<br>Avoid columns because scanners read from left to right.
<br>Send original printed resumes because photocopies do not scan clearly.
<br>Multiple page resumes are BETTER
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br><b><u>Action Verbs</u></b>
<br>When describing your Job Skills (i.e., what you do, what you did, etc.),
always use action verbs. Avoid general statements like: "duties included"
or "responsible for".
<p>And remember: do not misrepresent your duties -- describe them as professionally
and accurately as possible.

find useful in describing your Job Skills.
