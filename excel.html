<p>Open Excel, hit Alt-F11 - and another window will open where you can write code. Macros, Subroutines, Functions. You can manipulate data in your spreadsheet, add buttons and forms, import/export data from/to databases and files, do complex processing, show data in excel sheets (tables, graphs). You can even make a stand-alone scripts - although I wouldn't recommend this in production environment - better use C# or Perl.</p>
<p>Nowadays VBA is used less because C# is getting more popular - using &quot;Microsoft Visual Studio Tools for Office&quot; or other tools like ExcelDna,  &quot;<a href="http://www.add-in-express.com/">Add-in-Express</a>&quot;, etc. Still VBA is a powerful and useful tool.</p>

<p>Note: <br>

          <li><span class="style1">XLA:</span> Open new excel file, go to VBA editor, enter one ore more functions or macros, save the file as Microsoft Excel Add-In (*.xla). It will usually go in a default directory like:&nbsp;C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\Application Data\Microsoft\AddIns . 
            To use your add-in in some project, go to menu Tools &gt; Add-Ins - and select the add-in in the list. Once it is installed - it will show in VBA project explorer - so you will be able to edit it as needed. You can  password-protect it (in VBA editor right-click on it in Project Explorer - go to properties, and select Protection tab). After enering the password don't forget to save from VBA window.</li>
          <li><span class="style1">XLL:</span> It is a special  type of DLL which have certain functions to work with Excel. You can create DLLs / XLLs using <span class="style1">Visual Studio</span> and <span class="style1">VSTO</span> (Visual Studio Tools for Office - C++, C#, or VB.NET).  
            But much better to use <span class="style1">ADD-IN-EXPRESS</span>. Fastest performance (by far) is achieved when using C#. When creating XLLs you have to take care of many problems, for example converting variable types between C++ and Excel, or to think about threading (Latest versions of Excel are multithreaded, whereas the default for XLL is singlethreaded).</li>
