<p>TRIZ is probably one of the most profound inventions of 20th century.&nbsp;
It is now used in thousands of organizations around the world.&nbsp; There
are associations, magazines, discussions, books on the subject.&nbsp; TRIZ
gives you a proven algorithm of how to think to make inventions.&nbsp;
Instead of luck you now have a well defined proven method.

(ARIZ)</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">by G. S. Altshuller (1985)</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">ARIZ is a sophisticated tool. Do not use it for
solution of new problems if you have not passed at least the 80-hours course
of training.(+)</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">ARIZ is a tool for thinking, but it cannot be
used instead of thinking. Do not be in a hurry! You should make a detailed
consideration of each your step. In addition, it is obligatory to note
all ideas arising while solving a problem.</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">ARIZ is designed for solution of non-standard
problems. Please be attentive: maybe your problem can be solved with standard
methods.</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">ARIZ have been sampled in solution of a lot of
problems, practically the whole pool of problems used in TRIZ training.
Forgetting this, some peoples propose "hot" improvements based on solution
of only one problem. These improvements may be useful for only this one
problem, but making it easier they, as a rule, hamper the solution of all
other problems...</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">Any suggestion should be first tested out of
ARIZ (as it was, for example, with the small smart people method). After
being added to ARIZ each suggestion must be sampled on solution of at least
20-25 sufficiently complicated problems. ARIZ is always improved and therefore
it needs in new ideas, but these ideas must be first carefully tested.</font></td>

<p><img SRC="images/altshuller_old.gif" HSPACE=12 VSPACE=12 height=190 width=150 align=RIGHT>Genrich
S. Altshuller, born in the former Soviet Union in 1926. His first invention,
for scuba diving, was when he was only 14 years old. Became a mechanical
engineer. Served in the Soviet Navy as a patent expert in the 1940s.&nbsp;
His job was to help inventors apply for patents. He found, however, that
often he was asked to assist in solving problems as well.&nbsp; He started
to search for standard methods of problem solving.
<p>Altshuller screened over 200,000 patents looking for inventive problems
and how they were solved. Of these (over 2,500,000 patents have now been
screened), only 20% had somewhat inventive solutions; the rest were straight
forward improvements. Altshuller more clearly defined an inventive problem
as one in which the solution causes another problem to appear, such as
increasing the strength of a metal plate causing its weight to get heavier.
Usually, inventors must resort to a trade-off and compromise between the
features and thus do not achieve an ideal solution. In his study of patents,
Altshuller found that many described a solution that eliminated or resolved
the contradiction and required no trade-off.
<p><img SRC="images/altov.jpg" height=149 width=150 align=LEFT>Altshuller
categorized these patents in a novel way. Instead of classifying them by
industry, such as automotive, aerospace, etc., he removed the subject matter
to uncover the problem solving process. He found that often the same problems
had been solved over and over again using one of only forty (40) fundamental
inventive principles. If only later inventors had knowledge of the work
of earlier ones, solutions could have been discovered more quickly and
efficiently.
<p>In the 1960s and 1970s, he categorized the solutions into five levels:
<br>1 - Routine design problems solved by methods well known within the
specialty. No invention needed. About 32% of the solutions fell into this
level.
<br>2 - Minor improvements to an existing system, by methods known within
the industry. Usually with some compromise. About 45% of the solutions
fell into this level.
<br>3 - Fundamental improvement to an existing system, by methods known
outside the industry. Contradictions resolved. About 18% of the solutions
fell into this category.
<br>4 - A new generation that uses a new principle to perform the primary
functions of the system. Solution found more in science than in technology.
About 4% of the solutions fell into this category.
<br>5 - A rare scientific discovery or pioneering invention of essentially
a new system.
<br>About 1% of the solutions fell into this category.
<p>He also noted that with each succeeding level, the source of the solution
required broader
<br>knowledge and more solutions to consider before an ideal one could
be found.
