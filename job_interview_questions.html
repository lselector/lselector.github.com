<p><b><font color="#CC0000">Job Interview Questions</font></b>
<p>On this page there is a short list of possible questions. Try to play
the game of interview - and answer them laud and clear - as you would do
on the interview. While answering you should concentrate on positive only,
avoid negativity, project confidence, be relaxed. This comes with practice.
Remeber - never tell bad things about your previous boss or company. Always
tell that you move on because you want to grow, get more challenge, etc.
