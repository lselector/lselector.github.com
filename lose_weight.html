<br>
It is very simple to lose weight.<br>
Eat vegetables, walk outside (get yourself a dog). <br>
Remove or reduce all animal products, meats, milk, cheeses, all dairy. <br>
Remove all boxed or processed foods (including sugar, bread, all oils (even olive oil)).<br>
That's it.<br>
<br>
Vegetables have very low calory density.<br>
You can eat a lot of them - and still lose weight. <br> 
And as you remove sugar and processed foods - your hunger will disappear.<br>
So you will feel ok to skip meals (or even fast for a day or two).

    <td bgcolor="#FFCC66" valign="top"><p>        I was overweight for ~20 years.<br>
        Now I finally found the way to return to &quot;younger thinner&quot; me.<br>
        I am successfully losing weight long term.<br>
        Most americans fail to do that.<br>
        Probability of success is less than 1 in 10,000.</p>
    <p>It took me ~20 years to find what works (and what doesn't).<br>
      And the answers are surprisingly simple.<br>
      But it is not one thing - there are many small things, here and there.<br>
      I keep adjusting my approach to make it better.</p>
    <p>I am losing weight in a very relaxed way.<br>
      No strict diet.<br>
      As of today I have lost ~56  since 2010.<br>
      Here are the top links describing the methods I am using:</p>
    <p> - <a href="https://intensivedietarymanagement.com">https://intensivedietarymanagement.com</a> (Jason Fung - book &quot;Obesity Code&quot;)<br>
      - <a href="http://www.leangains.com">http://www.leangains.com</a> - <br>
      - <a href="http://www.eatstopeat.com">http://www.eatstopeat.com</a> - <br>

      - <a href="http://www.maryomalley.com">http://www.maryomalley.com</a> - </p>
    <p>Main ideas:<br>
      -- &quot;eat less, exercise more&quot; formula doesn't work <strong>long term</strong>.<br>
      -- eating less - causes metabolism slowdown and doesn't work <strong>long term</strong> for 95% of people.<br>
      -- exercise - contributes less than 5% (if any) - if you consider<strong> long term</strong>.</p>
    <p>- oscillating (eat - stop_eat, a.k.a. intermittent fasting), works and doesn't cause slowdown.<br>
      Note - world record in long fasting is 382 days !<br>
      - <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2495396/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2495396/</a> - <br>
      - <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2495396/pdf/postmedj00315-0056.pdf">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2495396/pdf/postmedj00315-0056.pdf</a> - </p>
    <p> Recommended lengths of regular fasting are from 12 hours to several days<br>
(world record - 382 days without food).<br>
      - <a href="https://intensivedietarymanagement.com/fasting-regimens-part-6/">https://intensivedietarymanagement.com/fasting-regimens-part-6/</a> - <br>
      - <a href="https://intensivedietarymanagement.com/longer-fasting-regimens-part-7/">https://intensivedietarymanagement.com/longer-fasting-regimens-part-7/</a> - </p>
    <p> My method is close to described in leangains.com - I just skip breakfast and lunch every day (12..20 hrs fast).<br>
      Also important to avoid snacking between meals - to allow insulin levels to decrease.<br>
      - <a href="https://intensivedietarymanagement.com/perils-snacking-hormonal-obesity-xiii/">https://intensivedietarymanagement.com/perils-snacking-hormonal-obesity-xiii/</a></p>
    <p> Another important point - eat mostly vegetables, <br>
      removed or reduced all processed foods (sugar, bread, etc., oils), meets, dairy.<br>
      <br>
      I removed sugar almost completely (and any sweet taste).<br>
      I removed bred, pasta, and all other products made of flour.<br>
      I reduced significantly milk and dairy, also all meet products.
      <br>
      <br>
      I try to eat naturally (lots of salads, and no pre-done &quot;boxed&quot; foods).<br>
      I try to somewhat control portions at night (not to overeat).<br>
      I weigh myself daily and keep records with phone  app &quot;MyFitnessPal&quot;.<br>
      This helps me to keep track and make adjustments.</p>
    <p> - damaged metabolism (even diabetes type 2) can be reversed in just 2 weeks<br>
      using natural eating (no sugar, flower, etc. - only natural foods) plus some fasting</p>
    <p> - removing stress and oscillating  ( between activity and resting ) is very important.</p>
    <p> - inner work. I took the course &quot;Bright Line Healing&quot;, which is associated with &quot;Bright Line Eating&quot;.<br>
      Basic approach - remove judgement and shame, love yourself unconditionally.<br>
      Talk to your compulsion as it is a small child.<br>
      No accusations, no blame, no guilt, no war.<br>
      Instead - love, care, game, humor, patience.<br>
      (awareness, surrender, forgiveness, connection)<br>
    This is best explained by Mary O'Malley (search for her on youtube and on amazon).</p></td>

<p>When I came to USA in 1991, my weight was ~135 lbs.<br>
  In America I have discovered fresh juices, fast food, fries, etc.<br>
  I started gaining weight. <br>
  <br>
  I also started trying to lose weight. <br>
  Herbalife, gyms, multiple dieting approaches (sometimes extreme).<br>
  I was losing weight, then gaining more, then losing, then gaining even more.
  <br>
  Despite numerous attempts to lose weight, over ~19 years I ended up <br>
  gaining more than 130 lbs, 
peaking at 268 lbs in 2010.
<p>It was like using manual autojack. <br>
  Push down - it lifts up. <br>
  Over and over again.<br>
  <br>
  Good thing that I didn't give up!<br>
  Eventually in 2015 I believe I have found an approach that works.<br>
  Today I am at 214 lbs (lost ~54 lbs), <br>
  and my weight is steadily going down.
<p>My goal is to return close to 145 lbs in a couple of years.<br>
  And may be return to 135 lbs (my 30 y.old weight).<br>
I will be updating pictures from time to time so that you could see before/after. <br>
Note - I am a programmer, so I spend most of my day sitting in front of a computer.<br>
I don't go to gym, but recently I started working out with a personal trainer<br>
at a children's playground near my house twice a week.<br>
Overall I don't move much.
<p>I am using a very  relaxed lazy approach to losing weight.<br>
I don't follow any strict diet.<br>
Below you will find detailed descriptions of what I am doing,<br>
as well as links to original authors.
<p>Note: <br>
  it is very important that I don't force myself to diet or to lose weight.<br>
  I tried will power before. I tried dieting, going to gym 3-4 times per week.<br>
  It worked, but it was taking  real time, effort, and money.<br>
<br>
And it was not sustainable long term, because as soon as I would <br>
change the job and break the routine, I would immediately start <br>
gaining weight again.<br>
  <br>
  That's why I got convinced that it is really important to follow <br>
  a program which you can stick to long term and which doesn't<br>
  require going to gym, spending lots of time, or forcing yourself.<br>
  <br>
  My current program is easy, I feel myself in control, <br>
and I know that I will never gain the weight back again.<br>
<p class="sectionheader"><a NAME="US_Obesity_Epidemic" id="US_Obesity_Epidemic"></a>Obesity Epidemic in USA ------------------------------</p>
<p>People in America become more and more obese desipite the fact that everyone talks about losing weight.<br>
  There are diets, special programs, gyms, ...<br>

  Note - starting 2011 the methodology of collecting data has changed, but the trend still continues during 2011-2013.
  <br>
  Here is the most recent map - for 2013:
<br>
<img src="images/obesity_trends_2013.jpg" width="444" height="300" alt="Obesity 2013" border="1"></p>
<p>There is a lot of discussion about the causes of growing obesity. <br>
  The main causes are probably grains, sugars, corn, fructose syrup, etc. which are added into everything. <br>
  Also artificial foods contain less nutrients. <br>
  Also portions are huge.<br>
  Also  sugary drinks are served everywhere.<br>
  Most of the foods in the store are not good for your health.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="style1">Living in the US is like walking across a minefield. <br>
  Probably 90% of foods which are being sold in supermarkets are not good for you.<br>
  </span><span class="style1"><br>
  If you will be doing what is considered &quot;normal&quot; - you will get fat and sick like the rest of americans.<br>
  To stay healthy (and lean) you have to do something different from what is considered &quot;normal&quot;. </span><br>
</p>
<p class="sectionheader"><a NAME="Jon_Calvo" id="Jon_Calvo3"></a>People Don't Lose Weight ------------------------------</p>
<p>Ask anyone how to lose weight.<br>
  And people will give you a detailed answer.<br>
  Everyone knows the formula &quot;Eat less - move more&quot; (which doesn't work long term, by the way).<br>
It is all over TV and media.<br>
  There are approximately 37 thousand books on amazon related to weight loss.<br>
I just googled &quot;how many people are on a diet in america&quot;, and got this:<br>
 &quot;estimated 45 million Americans diet each year and spend $33 billion annually on weight loss products&quot;.<br>
There are other estimates which are much higher (more than 100 Mln).</p>
<p>So people know what to do. Or do they?<br>
  Millions of people are on a diet.<br>
But the probability of losing weight and keeping it off for long time is actually only 1 in 10,000.<br>
Yes, only one out of ten thousand succeeds !!<br>
Most of the people fail.<br>
You probably know someone who has lost weight - and then gained it back.<br>
<br>
There are so many diets, shakes, pills.<br>
  There are also programs, like Weight Watches, for example.<br>
But even W.W. have less than 2% success rate.</p>
<p>So losing weight is not as simple as 
  &quot;Eat less and exercise more&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p class="sectionheader"><a NAME="Jon_Calvo" id="Jon_Calvo5"></a>Willpower is very limited ------------------------------</p>
<p>Willpower is very limited and it is easy to completely drain it by doing <br>
  any kind of work which requires decision making (even simple decisions<br>
like weather to delete or not an email).<br>
  Here is a very good book about it:<br>
  - Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength  - by Roy Baumeister   &amp; John Tierney.<br>
  <br>
  Also here is a very good article:<br>
- <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html</a></p>
<p>  People usually break their resolutions when they are tired <br>
  and their willpower is at its minimum. So one of the tricks is to<br>
  understand this - and change your life style so that you don't<br>
  have to making food decisions at times  when your willpower is low.<br>
  <br>
  Also you should learn to replenish your willpower. <br>
And to avoid activities which drain it (like torturing yourself with exercise, for example).</p>
<p>You can help you by:<br>
&nbsp; - adding social support and/or influence<br>
&nbsp; - create habits - then use the force of habits to overpower urges.<br>
</p>
<p class="sectionheader"><a NAME="Jon_Calvo" id="Jon_Calvo2"></a>Food Addiction is Real ------------------------------</p>
<p>Many people have developed food addictions.<br>
  Food addictions can be as strong as drug addiction or alcoholism.<br> 
  FA is real, it was proven by multiple scientific studies.<br>
  Every year more than 100 thousand people in America lose their limbs or go blind <br>
  because of type 2 diabetes. Which could've been prevented by simply<br>
  changing their eating habits. But those people struggled and failed to do this.<br>
  <br>
  Some foods (like sugar or flower) are extremely potent at promoting FA (Food Addiction).<br> 
It was shown that brain chemistry changes (down-regulation of dopamin receptors).<br>
<br>
The good thing is that there are ways to reverse the process. Read on.<br>
</p>
<p class="sectionheader"><a NAME="Jon_Calvo" id="Jon_Calvo4"></a>Forcing yourself doesn't work ------------------------------</p>
<p>When people go an a diet, they mostly see it as a struggle and sacrifice.<br>
  But willpower usually only works for a short term (several weeks or several months).<br> 
  It never works long term.<br>
Why?<br>
Because the basic instinct of a human brain is to avoid pain and to gain pleasure.<br> 
This is our nature.<br>
You can not go against the nature for long term.<br>
Nobody can.<br>
<br>
Also, the more you prohibit something - the more desirable it becomes.<br>
Remember prohibition times in USA (when alcohol was prohibited)?<br>
Prohibition has caused an effect oposite to the desired outcome.<br>
Same with diet. Putting yourself on a strict limiting diet create a strong opposing<br>
action. In reality the surest way to gain weight long term is to put yourself on a strict diet.
<br>
<br>
If you talk to people who has kept their weight off for a long time - you will find<br>
that they found a way to stay thin without torturing themselves.<br>
<br> 
The trick is to make adjustments in your habits in such a way that they are easy<br>
to follow and keep you satisfied and happy. These habits are different for different <br>
people. You have to find your own. You need to 
learn about weight regulation, <br>
foods, brain, life styles. It takes time.<br>
<br>
If you are a highly-addicted type - then you should be very strict at preserving<br>
your new habits. You should stay &quot;clean&quot; for years and years. <br>
The attraction to certain foods never goes away.<br>
<br>
You should not blame yourself when you accidentally slip into old bad behavior. <br>
Instead just resume good behaviors.

<p class="sectionheader"><a NAME="Jon_Calvo" id="Jon_Calvo"></a>Jon Calvo ------------------------------</p>
<p>My initial inspiration in 2015 was (is) Jon Calvo.<br>
      He has lost ~190 lbs (from 340 lbs down to 150 lbs).<br>
      His current weight is 175 lbs (he gained some muscle).</p>
<p><img src="images/Jon_Calvo_Transformation.jpg" width="540" height="359"></p>
<p>Jon has tried different approaches.<br>
Eventually what worked for him:<br>
- eating: <span class="style1">intermitted fasting</span> + macro nutrients cycling<br>
- exercises: <span class="style1">resistance training</span> (heavy, power-lifting)<br>
- app for smartphone: <span class="style1">MyFitnessPal</span><br>

<p class="sectionheader"><a NAME="what_I_am_doing_to_lose_weight" id="books_websites2"></a>What I am doing to lose weight ------------------------------</p>
<p>What I am doing is very simple, relaxed and lazy.<br>
  It is not as disciplined and precise as what Jon Calvo is doing.<br>
  He exercises 3 times per week - and does carb cycling<br>
(eating more carbs on training days, less carbs on rest days).<br>
I don't exercise and don't do carb-cycling.<br>
May be I will have to start doing it through when I will get leaner.
<br>
  <br>
  <span class="style1">The most important for me was the realization that:<br>
  </span>- You can stop eating for 2-3 days without any negative effect to your abilities or health.<br>
- You will NOT go into starvation mode if you don't eat for for a day.<br>
-  You should NOT overeat even if you are following low carb diet. Average daily calories do matter.<br>
- No sugar, no bread. You should 
strictly cut off all sugars and all flour-based foods.<br>
&nbsp; Also limit or remove high-carb foods (sweet drinks, dried fruites, dates, and other very sweet fruites,<br>
&nbsp; chips, 
fries, chocolate, protein bars, etc.). <br>
  - It is OK to eat at night and skip breakfast.<br>
  &nbsp; 
  If you don't exercise, then it doesn't matter how you distribute your food throughout the day. <br>
  &nbsp; 
  You can eat mostly in the morning, or at night, or spread into 3..6 meals throughout the day. <br>
  &nbsp; But most comfortable is to eat the main meal at night ~2 hours before going to sleep.
  <br>
  - it is difficult to limit yourself to many small portions. <br>
  &nbsp; 
  It is much easier and more comfortable to stop 
  eating for some time (first half of the day), <br>
  &nbsp; 
  and then eat normal portions at night.<br>
  - if you feel hungry - it doesn't mean that your body needs nutrition.<br>
  &nbsp; You can  go without food for another 2-3 days.
  <br>
  &nbsp; 
  May be what you feel is just stress, or you need to drink water.<br>
  &nbsp; May be you 
  didn't have enough sleep.<br>
  &nbsp; So try to drink, relax, walk, or exercise. <br>
  &nbsp; 
  Don't use food as a stress reliever.<br>
  - Don't use exercise as a method to lose weight. <br>
 &nbsp; You don't have to exercise to lose weight. <br>
  &nbsp; 
  Walking helps. Exercise helps too, but you don't have too.<br>
  - Proper eating is the main thing: <br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. How much your eat (Calories), macros (protein, fat, carbs)<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Food choices (whole natural foods)
  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Structure (how many meals, when (intermittent fasting), cheat days, etc.)</p>
<p><br>
  <span class="style1">Here is what I am doing. </span><br>
  Very simple:<br>
  -  Most important - skip breakfast and lunch (avoid snacks too),  and only eat at night at ~8..9pm.<br>
  &nbsp; This is called intermittent fasting. <br>
  &nbsp; 
  Every day I have a 16-20 hr fasting period followed by 8-4 hr feeding period.<br>
  - get on the scale every morning - and enter my weight into MyFitnessPal app on my iPhone.<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; - <a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com/profile/levselector764">http://www.myfitnesspal.com/profile/levselector764</a><br>
  - drink lots of water, also some coffee. Carry a glass water bottle in my bag.<br>
  -  keep  total calorie intake low (don't over-eat at night).<br>
  - make sure to eat enough protein (meat, chicken, fish in my case) and some fat (but not much). <br>
  - 
  get carbs from vegetables/salads. Fruits are OK.<br>
  - 
  Cut out completely all processed carbs (sugar(s), bread, pasta, corn syrup, sweet drinks, dried fruites , craisins, etc.).<br>
  &nbsp; Ref?ned or sweet-loaded foods create addiction and cravings. <br>
  &nbsp; 
They change sensitivity of dopamin receptors in your brain.<br>
  &nbsp; Once you are hooked - you only can feel good if you consume them.<br>
  &nbsp; 
  Think of them as of addictive drugs. You have to go clean, to restore your hormonal regulation.<br>
- Do NOT start exercising, because it takes willpower. Do some stretching, walking.<br>
&nbsp; Later you can add  strength exercises (bodyweight, dumbels, rubber band). <br>
  - I am forgiving and kind to myself. I try to relax, sleep more. Do something active on weekends.
  <br>
  - It is OK to cheat from time to time. I am not taking things  too seriously. Be flexible.<br>
  &nbsp; 
  But when cheating happens - learn from it to make it easier next time.<br>
  &nbsp; 
  Avoid an avalanche. Avoid &quot;What the hell&quot; effect.<br>
  &nbsp; 
Recognize that the main danger is not in cheating, but in allowing one cheat meal to snowball into many.<br>
- You are NOT obligated to eat/drink when other people around you are doing it (at a party/meeting/etc.).<br>
&nbsp; It is the same as that you are not obligated to smoke if other people are smoking.

<p class="sectionheader"><a NAME="Lose_Weight_Advice" id="Lose_Weight_Advice"></a>Lose Weight Advice ------------------------------</p>
<p> If you are planning to slim down, you may find these my notes very useful.<br>
  I was trying to lose weight many times over the last 15-20 years - without any success.<br>
But I am successful now (finaly).<br>
Here are some things I have discovered which worked for me.</p>
<p>(1) Structure eating during the day using intermittent fasting appproach.<br>
  Basically just  skip breakfast and lunch, and only eat after work at ~8pm.<br>
No snacks (almost). Lots of water. </p>
<p>(2) Make your food selection close to paleo diet. <br>
  Protein-focused - make sure you get enough protein (but not too much),<br>
  some fat, 
  and vegetables. And some whole fruit.<br>
  <br>
  (3) It is not a battle. It is impossible to do this on &quot;will power&quot;. Not long term.<br>
  <br>
(4) You should allow yourself to eat anything you like from time to time.<br>
  You should not put yourself into prison of promising to never eat something.<br>
  <br>
  (5) You have to love yourself and love what you eat and how much you eat.<br>
  This is very important. You should love yourself as you are.<br>
You should not be ashamed of yourself or blame yourself.<br>
Do not fight with yourself. Accept yourself, forgive yourself, love yourself. <br>
  <br>
  (6) You have to start changing what you eat by finding things <br>
  which are better for you - and which you love. <br>
  Search youtube for success stories.<br>
  <br>
  (7) It is more about creating new alternative habits and introducing <br>
  new things into your life than removing bad habits. <br>
  You can't remove bad habits without first finding and installing new ones. <br>
  So don't try to &quot;stop doing something&quot;. <br>
  Instead try to &quot;start doing something new&quot;. <br>
  Add new foods. <br>
  Put new foods in your office table or in your fridge.<br>
  <br>
  (8) If you do a lot of exercise - you will need to add carbs (fruit, rice, etc.).<br>
  But if you like me and mostly sit in front of the computer,<br>
  you most probably  need to go lowcarb (Atkins' diet, paleo diet).<br>
  Definitely cut out processed carbs almost completely:<br>
no sugar, bread, pasta, cereals, healthy bars, etc.<br>
And I highly recommend to stop eating out at restaurants every day.<br>
<br>
(9) I like to eat only in the evening. I skip breakfast and lunch<br>
and only eat with my family when I return home from work.<br>
(see Nate Miaki - half-day diet).
<br>
But if you eat during the day - start brining your own food to work. <br>
  Search youtube for lowcarb fridge or lowcarb recepes. <br>
  See what other  people are doing.<br>
  <br>
  (10) Snacks are more important (dangerous) than the main   meals. <br>
  Avoid snacks if you can.<br>
  If you have to have them - then get good natural snacks. Don't buy &quot;healthy&quot; bars, etc.<br>
  Some people buy small fridges to keep snacks available under the table. <br>
  <br>
  (11) Water is very important. I made a habit to regularly drink a glass of water.<br>
  First thing in the morning, first thing I do when I come to the office, or back home.<br>
  Before every meal. Etc. I carry a glass water bottle in my bag.<br>
  <br>
(12) You have to install small new routines. Like getting on the scale every morning<br>
and enterring your weight into MyFitnessPal app on my smart phone. <br>
Like
drinking more water, sleepng more, etc.<br>
You also should make routines to avoid some situations in which you may be tempted to eat junk.<br>
It is not about will power - it is about creating new routines, new habits.<br>
<br>
  (13) You have to create systems to avoid temptations. <br>
  You have limited amount of will power,  and you will be tempted the most when <br>
  you are tired and nervous. So help yourself: <br>
  &nbsp; - create  habits and routines, substitute discipline with habits.<br>
  &nbsp; - prepare meals in advance (or at least write what you will eat in advance)<br>
  &nbsp; - do NOT eat junk with others in social situations - it is OK to say NO.<br>
  &nbsp; - drink instead of eating<br>
  &nbsp; -  distract yourself by talking to someone, texting, emailing, helping someone. <br>
  &nbsp; - 
  Meditate, pray, think about your life, feel gratitude, look at your family pictures on your phone, etc.<br>
  <br>
  (14) Some things work, some don't. Some work for a period of time, and then stop working.<br>
  So you need to adjust, to change. <br>
  It is a constant discovery process. <br>
  <br>
  (15) The process takes time. See estimates below.<br>
It is not a sprint, it is not a battle.<br>
It is all about installing small new habits one by one.<br>
<br>
  (16) Physical exercises may help, but also may deplete your will power. <br>
  So it is better to concentrate your will on setting up food habits.<br>
  You can start exercising later when you have new feeding habits.
  <br>
  <br>
  (17) Do NOT use exercise to lose weight by burning calories.<br>
  Definitely not long term.<br>
  Use exercising to improve your health. And use strength<br>
training to avoid losing muscle while on caloric deficit and losing weight.</p>

<p><br>
The almost guaranteed way to extend life is<br>
... 
to simply limit food intake.<br>
<br>
This was  proven in 
  multiple experiments on animals<br>
(rats, mice, monkeys, etc.). <br>
To keep animals healthier you can also decrease<br>
the 
temperature (cool is better than hot), and provide<br>
conditions for running, climbing, and playing.</p>
<p>Health benefits of limiting food intake (fasting) were<br>
  also    shown multiple times for humans. <br>
  You can stop eating for  several days (world record<br>
  is 382 without food), and only benefit 
  from it. <br>
  But most people are afraid to skip even a single meal!<br>
  <br>
  On the other side if you put an animal (typically<br>
  a cat or a dog, or a human) into a warm apartment <br>
  with abundant    food supply, the poor animal will get all <br>
  human 
  diseases, 
  including heart disease and cancer.</p>
<p>You don't need to eat all the time.<br>
  TV advertises food. But food is THE  major killer.<br>
  <br>
  Humans are the first species in the history who eat <br>
  not because they 
  need nutrition, but for comfort and <br>
  when they meet  (socializing).<br>
  <br>
  Before eating, ask yourself if your body needs this food, <br>
  or you are doing  it for comfort or social reasons only. <br>
  <br>
  Are you OK with killing yourself?</p>
<p class="sectionheader"><a NAME="Carb_Cycling" id="Carb_Cycling"></a>Carb Cycling ------------------------------</p>
<p>  Progression of Body Builders' techniques over the years:<br>
  ============<br>
  1st (very old) approach - 2-phase method: bulking &amp; cutting.<br>
  Length of cycle - months.<br>
  bulking - exercise and eat a lot to gain muscle (and fat).<br>
  cutting - lose weight before competitions<br>
  (which results also in some muscle loss).<br>
  ============<br>
  2nd method - anabolic diet. (anabolic =  stimulating protein synthesis &amp;  muscle growth)<br>
  Length of cycle - one week:<br>
  Mon-Fri - eat no carbs (only protein and fat)<br>
  Sat, Sun - eat lots of carbs (plus protein and fat as usual)<br>
  ============<br>
  3rd method - carb cycling. <br>
  Length of cycle - 1 day.<br>
  Basically you alternate low carb - high carb days.<br>
  Plus you have one cheat/refeeding day per week when you eat a lot of carbs.<br>
  Typical example:<br>
  Mon, Wed, Fri - workout days, elevated carbs<br>
  Tue, Thu, Sat - rest days, low carb<br>
  Sun - re-feeding day, lots of carbs<br>
  Also to break pattern, they do re-feeding week once per several weeks.<br>

<p class="sectionheader"><a NAME="weight_loss_estimates"></a>Weight Loss Estimates ------------------------------</p>
<p>  Here are my weight loss estimates.<br>
Your numbers may differ.</p>
<p>Note - if you don't sleep enough, or under stress,<br>
  or eat very unhealthy, these numbers will not work.<br>
  <br>
  The numbers below reflect these two ideas:<br>
  <br>
  1. speed of losing weight is SLOW SLOW SLOW  (unless you do something heroic).<br>
  2. speed mostly depends on total caloric intake. 
  Exercising helps, but eating contributes more. <br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  You can &quot;out-eat&quot; any exercise.<br>
  3. if you are not an athlete, if you sit most of the day - then you should be low-carb.<br>
  <br>
  ========================================<br>
  My current weight - 222 lbs (Fall of 2015).<br>
  (peak on 1/1/2015 was 248, peak in 2010 was 268).<br>
  My LBW = 140 lbs (Lean Body Weight = weight without excess fat).<br>
  ========================================<br>
  My Basal Metabolism ~1700 Kcal/day.<br>
  - <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bmr_calculator.htm">http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bmr_calculator.htm</a><br>
  1500 Kcal for weight 140 lbs<br>
  2100 Kcal for weight 233 lbs<br>
  For estimates I am assuming a constant value of 1700 Kcal/day.<br>
  ========================================<br>
  1 lb of fat = 3500 Kcal<br>
  Caloric deficit 500/day = 3500/wk = 1 lb/wk weight loss.<br>
  <br>
  This deficit may be caused by:<br>
  - eating less<br>
  - exercising more<br>
  1 hr of exercising burns 300..500K (+200 after-burn).<br>
  So 1hr in gym EVERY DAY burns ~500/day, or 1 lb/wk.<br>
Exercising 1 hr 3 times per week will cause ~0.5 lbs/wk loss.</p>

   ========================================</pre>
<p>By being really consistent with the plan, 
and by doing some extra <br>
fasting or exercises,  you can reasonably lose ~10 lbs/month.<br>
When you start (your first month) - you will lose more, but then it slows down.<br>
I am loosing at a speed ~7lbs/month (or even slower sometimes).<br>
I decided that I will not rush it. <br>
For me it is important to be comfortable and relaxed. </p>
<p>But if you want to push it by adding  exercise, please note that<br>
  eating is still the most important factor. For example, you can<br>
  sweat for an hour in the gym, burn 500 Kcal, and then out-eat <br>
  your workout by eating just one burger (560 Kcal).
<p>Here are some choices of exercises 
in the order of &quot;laziness&quot;:
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" background="CCCCCC">
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#FFCC66" valign="top">Walking ~1 hr/day <br>
    or some other type <br>
    of activity.</td>
    <td bgcolor="#FFCC66" valign="top">Here is how much calories  you burn <br>
      during 1 hour of different activities:<br>
      <br>
      Watching TV - 70 (basal) <br>
      Computer/Desk work - 130-160 <br>
Walking - approx. 100 Kcal/mile&nbsp;&nbsp; (400 Kcal/h if walked 4 miles) <br>
Running - approx. 150 Kcal/mile&nbsp;&nbsp; (900 Kcal/h if ran 6 miles) <br>
Swimming -500-1000 <br>
Gym - 300-500<br>
Moving (carrying boxes) - 650 <br>
Badminton -  420 <br>
Aerobics&nbsp; - 400+ <br>
<br>
Note: walking is actually pretty good.<br>
Note: swimming is really good. If water is cold - you will burn <br>
even more calories.</td>

<p> As I am losing weight, I am starting feeling that it is easier for me to move, <br>
  and that I want to move more.<br>
  Moving used to be difficult &amp;  tiresome.<br>
  But now it becomes pleasant.<br>
So I gues going forward I will start moving more, and doing more exercises.</p>
<p>As a programmer I sit for 10-12 hrs/day  in front of the computer.<br>
  It is very unhealthy.<br>
  I need to compensate this with movement.<br>
  <br>
  I recently started doing short 2-5-min standing exercise sessions.<br>
  These are type of exercises I can do in the office.<br>
  The duration is short, so that I don't get sweaty.<br>
  I start with rotating my head and doing circles with arms.<br>
  Then do trunk rotations, bending from side to side, bending front to back,<br>
  making upper-body circles, squats, lunges, pushups.
  <br>
<br> 
Also I started walking 20min in the morning, 20 min at night.<br>
And I do breaks at work, and just walk around the office.<br>
  Overall I walk ~1hr/day.<br>
  <br>

What you will see:<br>
- People gained weight mostly because they have used food to distract themselves <br>
&nbsp; 
from some sort of pain  (stress, emotional problems, etc.)<br>
&nbsp; Also they were eating junk (sugar and flour based foods and drinks). <br>
- There is no magic in what people were doing to lose weight: diet and exercise.<br>
&nbsp; 
People have used different regimens, and it was mostly simply based on will power and discipline. <br>
&nbsp; 
But most of these regimens are not designed for long-term maintenance.<br>
&nbsp; Thus you should NOT use them as role models.
<br>
- TV mostly concentrates on drama, emotions, and amazing stories of fast and dramatic fat loss.<br>
&nbsp; (20-30 lbs/month, 100..500  lbs loss). But the winners of those shows <br>
&nbsp; 
(&quot;The Biggest Loser&quot;, &quot;Extreme Weight Loss&quot;, etc.)<br>
&nbsp; frequently gain their weight back. Because they lost weight not by creating<br>
&nbsp; new good effective habits, but by using will power,  which never works long term.<br>

  Also, the methods used on those shows are not healthy (LiveScience.com):<br>
  <span class="comment">&quot;... physicians and nutritionists worry the (Biggest Loser) show's focus <br>
  on competitive weight loss is, at best, counterproductive and, at worst, dangerous</span>&quot;. <br>
  Contestants on the show lose upwards of 10 pounds per week <br>
(... some contestants have lost 20&ndash;30+ pounds in that one week alone)</p>
