The Future of Online Publishing
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Interlude - Mini-Sites
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This week I'm altering the schedule again, and slipping
in a&nbsp; tool that I missed in the original list. Mini-sites. They're&nbsp;
one of the most effective tools for online publishers of any&nbsp; type.
<p>&nbsp;They're also one of the cheapest and easiest to create and&nbsp;
profit from. This article makes them sound simple. That's&nbsp; because
they are. Don't let that fool you, though.
<p>&nbsp;They work. As you'll see, they sometimes work Big.
<p>&nbsp;Allan Gardyne and Phil Wiley have both done series on them,&nbsp;
which have been quite interesting, and Marlon Sanders has a&nbsp; book
out covering the concept extremely thoroughly.
<p>&nbsp;To see Allan's series, go to:
<p>&nbsp;http://www.AssociatePrograms.com/search/newsletter136.shtml
<p>&nbsp;It's a four parter. To see the next three parts, replace the&nbsp;
136 with 137, 138, and 139. I won't get into much of what he&nbsp; covers
here, beyond the basics. It's been done well already.&nbsp; ;)
<p>&nbsp;Phil's articles have covered some of the same things, and&nbsp;
added some interesting perspectives. His aren't available on&nbsp; the
web, as he's planning to expand on them and give up some&nbsp; of the nuts
and bolts in a commercial product.
<p>&nbsp;I intend to order it when it comes out.
<p>&nbsp;....
<p>&nbsp;The core idea is simple. You put together a one or two page&nbsp;
site (two only if you need an order form) promoting a specific&nbsp; action.
The site has one main purpose, usually to sell a&nbsp; product.
<p>&nbsp;Everything on that page should be focused around the idea of&nbsp;
getting the visitor to take that action. Everything. There&nbsp; should
be no distractions allowed in the design of the page.
<p>&nbsp;Let's be clear on what that means...
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * No Flash or other plug-ins needed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * No heavy graphics.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * No links to anything but the order
form.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * No editorial, unless your desired
action relates to the topic of the editorial, and&nbsp; then only if it's
absolutely necessary.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * No "filler" content.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * No gimmicks of any kind.
<p>&nbsp;In short, there should be nothing for the visitor to do but&nbsp;
take the desired action or go to another site.
<p>&nbsp;Of course, you need to provide them with the right reason to&nbsp;
act, but that's another article. Or book. Or something...
<p>&nbsp;....
<p>&nbsp;You put the page up and drive targeted traffic to it. The&nbsp;
tighter the targeting, the better the response to both your&nbsp; traffic
generation methods and your offer itself.
<p>&nbsp;For example, you might be in the business of selling music&nbsp;
CDs. A good mini-site would focus on a specific band (or&nbsp; better,
a specific album), or a narrow group of buyers. An&nbsp; example of the
latter would be parents who want music their&nbsp; kids will like and that
they approve of.
<p>&nbsp;Very tight targeting is a key to this.
<p>&nbsp;....
<p>&nbsp;Keep the ordering process simple, and automate as much as&nbsp;
possible. The goal, which you'll never completely reach,&nbsp; should be
to cut direct human involvement in the ordering and&nbsp; fulfillment process
to zero.
<p>&nbsp;That allows you to focus on marketing the site, doing customer&nbsp;
service, working up good back end offers, or relaxing on the&nbsp; beach.
Whatever it is that you want to do most.
<p>&nbsp;....
<p>&nbsp;Driving targeted traffic is relatively easy. If you've&nbsp; achieved
a good conversion rate (tested, of course) and the&nbsp; income per action
is sufficient, you can go the simple route:&nbsp; Pay for it.
<p>&nbsp;Buy links/ads on other sites or in newsletters, preferably on&nbsp;
a per visitor basis. Use the pay per click search engines. Use&nbsp; banner
networks that charge per clickthrough. Anything that&nbsp; gives you control
of your cost per visitor. Then watch those&nbsp; numbers carefully to make
sure they keep generating a profit.
<p>&nbsp;Buying traffic in small, controlled doses is also a great way&nbsp;
to test the results from the site. Track, tweak, and make sure&nbsp; the
thing will return a decent conversion rate (read:&nbsp; profitable), THEN
roll out the big guns.
<p>&nbsp;This applies even if you're not going to use paid traffic&nbsp;
builders as a rule. If you plan to do promotions to a limited&nbsp; group,
you may want to test on a sampling first. Even if it&nbsp; costs you a
bit more than it brings in, the increased returns&nbsp; from proper tweaking
will be well worth it in the long term.
<p>&nbsp;....
<p>&nbsp;If you're on a lower budget, or just want to play around with&nbsp;
the idea without spending money, you're going to have to get&nbsp; creative.
There's plenty of stuff out there on free&nbsp; promotional techniques.
Hit the search engines and you'll find&nbsp; more than you can read in
a month on the subject.
<p>&nbsp;Hey, I never promised I'd focus only on the free stuff, right?
<p>&nbsp;....
<p>&nbsp;There are three main uses for these "mini-sites."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Direct sales
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Pre-selling for an affiliate program
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Generating leads or subscribers
<p>&nbsp;Of course, they can be adapted to almost any online purpose,&nbsp;
but those are the biggies.
<p>&nbsp;....
<p>&nbsp;Direct sales: This is where the big money is. You can look at&nbsp;
any of the big names in online sales and see that their focus&nbsp; is
simple direct response. They'll tell you that.
<p>&nbsp;But they usually don't give you any benchmarks to measure&nbsp;
from. So, some examples, with real numbers, seemed in order.
<p>&nbsp;A friend of mine (We'll use Marsha as a name) had a high end&nbsp;
information product to promote. The price tag was just over&nbsp; $1000.
She also had a list of email addresses of clients who&nbsp; had specifically
requested info on special offers via email.
<p>&nbsp;She used a clean, professional looking, brain-dead simple web&nbsp;
page for the copy. No graphics at all. This was a half hour&nbsp; design
job. Literally.
<p>&nbsp;....
<p>&nbsp;The copy itself was a fairly traditional sales letter, with&nbsp;
only minor adjustments made to allow for the difference&nbsp; between the
web and print. The letter was roughly 12 pages&nbsp; long. The response
mechanism was a choice of going to the&nbsp; second page to request a phone
call (using a simple CGI form),&nbsp; or hanging up and calling a toll-free
number to order.
<p>&nbsp;I heard that. (You really shouldn't think so loudly!)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She didn't have an online ordering option?
She actually made people read a 12 page letter on the web - and then hang
up and make a phone call?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is she CRAZY?!?!"
<p>&nbsp;Yes, she is. But that's another story.
<p>&nbsp;The initial emails to her list got roughly a 35% clickthrough.&nbsp;
Of those, 8.76% ordered her $1000+ product.
<p>&nbsp;Marsha turned over $250,000 NET on that project, which took a&nbsp;
whopping three days to set up and two weeks to execute. Not&nbsp; bad for
her first foray into online sales.
<p>&nbsp;Was she crazy?
<p>&nbsp;....
<p>&nbsp;Some things to remember:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * This was a "house list," (they'd ordered
from her&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before), so credibility
and credit weren't issues&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - they
had both the money and the interest to buy.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * The offline ordering option was consistent
with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; both her style and the price
of the product.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * They had signed up to receive just this sort
of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; offer, via email.
<p>&nbsp;In short, an extremely targeted campaign.
<p>&nbsp;....
<p>&nbsp;I hear a lot of drooling going on among the new folks. No,&nbsp;
this is not typical...
<p>&nbsp;...unless you have a similar situation. Two other people I&nbsp;
know used almost identical approaches, and got results that&nbsp; were
so close, in terms of response rate and profit per email&nbsp; delivered,
that they might as well be identical.
<p>&nbsp;....
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But what about us folks that don't
sell 4-figure&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
info products to house lists?"
<p>&nbsp;Well, I guess you don't get to make a quarter of a million&nbsp;
bucks in two weeks then. The people in these examples spent&nbsp; years
developing reputations and customer lists. You can't&nbsp; duplicate that
overnight.
<p>&nbsp;Or can you? (More on that later.)
<p>&nbsp;....
<p>&nbsp;Side note:
<p>&nbsp;If you have those resources, why aren't you using them? If you&nbsp;
have an established client base, why aren't you giving them an&nbsp; incentive
to sign up for online offers?
<p>&nbsp;Did you think all those people who talked about the value of&nbsp;
building your email list were just running off at the mouth?
<p>&nbsp;If so, you might want to reconsider. Remember, folks... These&nbsp;
are NOT fictitious numbers. That's 250,000 cold, hard&nbsp; cash-in-the-bank
dollars.
<p>&nbsp;Pre-tax, of course, but it'll still buy a couple of nice&nbsp;
lunches.
<p>&nbsp;....
<p>&nbsp;For those who may have a great product, but lack an&nbsp; established
base, here are the key points in this example:
<p>&nbsp;1. Good conversion rate: The 35% clickthrough rate could&nbsp;
probably have been improved. If you can get an 8 or 9%&nbsp; conversion
rate, you're going to have plenty of money to work&nbsp; on that with.
<p>&nbsp;Better yet, test emails to your list in smaller samples.
<p>&nbsp;Pay attention to the numbers. Constantly work to improve them.&nbsp;
If you don't know your conversion rate, you might as well be&nbsp; playing
roulette.
<p>&nbsp;2. Targeted traffic: You do this through carefully designed&nbsp;
promotional materials. Whether it's search engine terms,&nbsp; banner ads,
article publishing, paid textual ads, or anything&nbsp; else - focus. Make
sure your promotions attract only those&nbsp; with a high degree of interest.
People who are going to be&nbsp; predisposed to take action.
<p>&nbsp;This is especially important for pay per click promotions. For&nbsp;
these, you should use "negative qualifiers." If you're paying&nbsp; by
the click, chase off everyone who isn't a perfect prospect.
<p>&nbsp;3. Credibility: This is a combination of things. If they don't&nbsp;
know you, you need to make sure they at least trust that what&nbsp; you're
saying is true. You can do this through the use of&nbsp; specific facts,
testimonials, press quotes, and/or&nbsp; endorsements.
<p>&nbsp;For new products or unknown producers, endorsements are the&nbsp;
way to go. You automatically gain the credibility of the&nbsp; endorser
with the market. Of course, this requires that your&nbsp; product is good
enough that they know they won't lose&nbsp; credibility themselves by endorsing
it.
<p>&nbsp;....
<p>&nbsp;Can you duplicate that overnight?
<p>&nbsp;Not quite, but in a whole lot less than 20 years. Or even 20&nbsp;
weeks, if you're smart and want to do it.
<p>&nbsp;Here's the approach:
<p>&nbsp;1. Get a good product that people will endorse.&nbsp; 2. Get a
process in place that converts visits to sales.&nbsp; 3. Offer good commissions
to people with credibility and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a large audience.
<p>&nbsp;Simple. Sometimes it's even easy.
<p>&nbsp;But not often. You may actually have to work here.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Ooops. There went half the audience...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But not the half that counts. ;)
<p>&nbsp;....
<p>&nbsp;Preselling for an affiliate program: This is a bit different,&nbsp;
but not all that much. (You probably don't want a 12 page&nbsp; sales letter
for this approach, for example...)
<p>&nbsp;A great example of this is Phil Wiley's site promoting Marlon&nbsp;
Sanders' book "Gimme My Money Now." This is a "warm up" site.&nbsp; Its
sole purpose is to create a predisposition to reading&nbsp; Marlon's sales
letter, and getting you to click on the&nbsp; affiliate link.
<p>&nbsp;The URL is http://www.philwiley.com
<p>&nbsp;This site generates about $350 a week in commissions. I won't&nbsp;
spoil the surprise by telling you how much it cost Phil to set&nbsp; this
up and host it for a year. That's part of his book. &lt;g>
<p>&nbsp;Take a look at this site. Notice how clean the layout is,&nbsp;
while still looking professional. Look closely at the way he&nbsp; handles
the copy. This is a beautiful example of a mini-site&nbsp; that works.
<p>&nbsp;Then take a look at Marlon's site. (Marlon is an odd bird in&nbsp;
marketing circles. He only preaches what he practices.)
<p>&nbsp;This is a textbook case. A well designed mini-site, pointing&nbsp;
to an affiliate program with a very high conversion rate and a&nbsp; good
commission payout.
<p>&nbsp;A prescription for cash.
<p>&nbsp;....
<p>&nbsp;Another good example is Allan Gardyne's site at
<p>&nbsp;http://www.LifetimeCustomers.com
<p>&nbsp;This is one small page, and focuses on just one primary aspect&nbsp;
of Ken Evoy's book, "Make Your Site Sell." The fact that it&nbsp; pays
commissions on everything a customer you refer to the&nbsp; site ever buys
from SiteSell.com.
<p>&nbsp;Take a look and break the site down in your mind. Allan is a&nbsp;
master at affiliate marketing. This site is an excellent&nbsp; example
of how to make it simple.
<p>&nbsp;I didn't ask about income on this one. For one thing, it's&nbsp;
going to be a regularly growing thing, due to the nature of&nbsp; the program.
For another, not many people have a list of&nbsp; 15,000+ devoted readers.
&lt;g>
<p>&nbsp;....
<p>&nbsp;These are interesting examples. To see if this sort of thing&nbsp;
could be duplicated, I went to someone who doesn't write about&nbsp; his
work professionally.
<p>&nbsp;The first name that came to mind was Wayne Porter, "Power&nbsp;
Affiliate," affiliate program consultant, and webmaster of&nbsp; http://www.affiliatehelp.com
<p>&nbsp;Wayne was extremely helpful. The example he provides is not&nbsp;
precisely a mini-site as they're usually described, but more&nbsp; of a
micro version of a themed site.
<p>&nbsp;The distinction is important. A themed site focuses on a&nbsp;
narrow slice of a topic, with multiple resources related to&nbsp; the topic.
A mini-site focuses on only one product.
<p>&nbsp;As an example, he gave me some stats on one of his earlier&nbsp;
experiments in affiliate marketing. The discussion follows:
<p>&nbsp;....
<p>&nbsp;TalkBiz: Thanks for agreeing to help out with this, Wayne. So,&nbsp;
what are we looking at?
<p>&nbsp;Wayne: The site is at http://www.free-cdroms.com
<p>&nbsp;This was one of my early experiments in affiliate marketing.&nbsp;
In this case I had decided to focus on a vertical market&nbsp; (cdrom collectors)
and use CPA deals. Specifically, free&nbsp; samples.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Editor's note: CPA stands for
Cost Per Action.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In these
programs, the affiliate gets paid when&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
someone takes an action that's not a sale.]
<p>&nbsp;I felt this would be a good approach because sampling is&nbsp;
natural behavior, and many people get samples online and then&nbsp; go
offline to make their purchase.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; TalkBiz: How's it working out, income-wise?
<p>&nbsp;Wayne: I do between $750 and $1000 a month from that site&nbsp;
alone.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; TalkBiz: How long did it take you to set the site up?
<p>&nbsp;Wayne: That one took me over a week. Now I can set them up&nbsp;
in a day or two. I find what I want to promote, highlight the&nbsp; best
features and then start my promotion process.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; TalkBiz: How long do you spend promoting it each month?
<p>&nbsp;Wayne:&nbsp; The free-cdroms.com site is a bad example as I spend&nbsp;
only 1 to 2 hours a month with it. I have far more demanding&nbsp; projects
at this point.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; TalkBiz: Not bad. A few days to set it up, 24 hours a year&nbsp;
promoting it, and $9000 to $12,000 a year in income for that&nbsp; time.
<p>&nbsp;How long do you spend on more typical mini-sites?
<p>&nbsp;Wayne: Because I balance multiple projects I try to keep&nbsp;
promotion down to about five hours per month per mini-site.
<p>&nbsp;I do have the advantage of having been online for some time&nbsp;
and have built relationships with webmasters who have a lot of&nbsp; established
traffic. I work on mutually beneficial ways to tap&nbsp; into that stream.
I also do traditional directory marketing,&nbsp; key word purchasing and
a little time each month tweaking key&nbsp; pages for search engines.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; TalkBiz: Sounds like these are pretty low maintenance sites.
<p>&nbsp;Wayne: That's the beauty of this approach. I do what I know&nbsp;
well, which is sending merchants visitors who are interested&nbsp; in their
offers before they even get to the merchant's site.
<p>&nbsp;When you have an established relationship with a segment of a&nbsp;
market, like topical newsletter subscribers, the key is to&nbsp; pre-sell
the product. That's very effective if you have&nbsp; established credibility
with your audience.
<p>&nbsp;In my case, it's much simpler. I find ways to get in front of&nbsp;
people who are already looking, and I give them ways to sort&nbsp; themselves
by their own interests.
<p>&nbsp;The merchants handle fulfillment, customer service, and all&nbsp;
the labor intensive parts of the business.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; TalkBiz: Smart approach. Classic marketing strategy, applied&nbsp;
to the net. How many visitors do you get to this site each&nbsp; month?
<p>&nbsp;Wayne: This particular site only gets about 150 unique&nbsp; visitors
a day, and 250-350 page views. Your readers make like&nbsp; a sneak peek
into the vital stats on one network.
<p>&nbsp;Here's the yearly production from one network on the site so&nbsp;
far this year. (This does not reflect the site's total&nbsp; earnings.
I use 6 different networks on this site.)
<p>&nbsp; Gross Sales: $4,931.91&nbsp;&nbsp; Sales: 100&nbsp;&nbsp; Leads:
1083&nbsp;&nbsp; Hits: 11618&nbsp;&nbsp; Impressions: 174871&nbsp;&nbsp;
CTR: 0.07&nbsp;&nbsp; CPM: $28.20&nbsp;&nbsp; Conversion Ratio: 0.10%
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; TalkBiz: Over 1000 leads and 100 sales. Not bad. But does
it&nbsp; duplicate well? What's your average monthly income per mini&nbsp;
site?
<p>&nbsp;Wayne: My mini-site performance can vary radically. This&nbsp;
particular site generates anywhere from $500-$1000 per month.&nbsp; That
depends on the offers I find, traffic, and other business&nbsp; factors.
<p>&nbsp;I have had mini-sites produce gross merchant sales as high as&nbsp;
$15,000.00 in one month. On average most do around $1000-$2000&nbsp; in
commissions per month. This site could do a lot more but I&nbsp; spend
little time with it. I have more lucrative projects to&nbsp; focus on.
<p>&nbsp;Of course, I've had some mini-sites that were total flops.&nbsp;
Because the incubation cost is so low, it's not a big loss,&nbsp; and the
data is very useful. In the case of free-cdroms.com I&nbsp; still have
it hosted on a free server so my yearly cost is&nbsp; $13.50.
<p>&nbsp;The ROI is quite good. I have CPMs as high as $450.00 on one&nbsp;
offer. I try to "carpet bomb" niches. Better to have one buyer&nbsp; then
100 casual surfers.
<p>&nbsp;....
<p>&nbsp;So, how does this fit in with online publishing?
<p>&nbsp;It's all direct response. Hard focus on results.
<p>&nbsp;It's an approach those with a generic product can use to catch&nbsp;
the attention of specific groups of serious prospects within&nbsp; their
market.
<p>&nbsp;It's a great way to multiply your effectiveness without&nbsp;
multiplying your time investment.
<p>&nbsp;It's an extremely efficient way to generate leads at low cost.
<p>&nbsp;It's a great way to test new approaches without tinkering with&nbsp;
a site that's bringing in satisfactory results right now.
<p>&nbsp;In short, it's the perfect way to hone your online marketing&nbsp;
skills and turn a profit in the process. Whether you're&nbsp; selling subscriptions
to an ezine or membership site, selling&nbsp; ebooks or software, giving
away free subscriptions to build an&nbsp; advertising or networking base,
or using any other&nbsp; info-centric business model, this is a tool you
don't want to&nbsp; ignore.
<p>&nbsp;And if you're just looking to develop a side income while you&nbsp;
learn, it's apparently pretty good for that, too. ;)
<p>&nbsp;....
<p>&nbsp;Look over the examples, and then read Allan's series on the&nbsp;
subject. Then re-read Wayne's responses. Note the approaches&nbsp; each
takes, and consider how you could apply those in your&nbsp; own situation.
<p>&nbsp;And notice Wayne's comment about working out mutually&nbsp; beneficial
deals with people with whom he's developed ongoing&nbsp; relationships.
We've used exactly those words in this space&nbsp; before. We (and Wayne)
call that networking.
<p>&nbsp;Don't just read this and nod your head (unless I'm putting you&nbsp;
to sleep). This is, unlike most of what you'll read about&nbsp; marketing
online, something so cheap and easy to implement&nbsp; that there's no
one who can't do it.
<p>&nbsp;And it's a great way to test your other marketing ideas.
<p>....
<p>You made it this far? Cool.
