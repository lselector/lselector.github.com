<p>If you want to make big money working as an employee or consultant -
then to maximize your income you should work only at large companies.&nbsp;
They have lots of money to pay high salaries.&nbsp; Small businesses, on
the contrary, will not be able to afford to pay you the salary you want.
<p><font color="#666600">As a matter of reference, current rates for programmers
on Wall Street (Summer 2001):</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#666600">Beginner ~$60K/year.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#666600">Typical developer with 3-5 years of experience (for
example, Senior Java developer for some brokerage project) - $80K - $120K

<li>
<font color="#666600">Individual consultant with unique or rare expertise
in some new expensive enterprise technology - ~$200/hour (I've seen up

<li>
<font color="#666600">Typical payment to a consulting firm for some middleware

</ul>

<p><br>OK, for today we selected programming for large companies (in NY
City especially in 3 areas - finance, publishing, advertising). So you
have to find out what technologies they are using.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#990000">Now, let's narrow down the technologies.</font></b></center>

<p>As of today (Summer 2001) the most in-demand general (not package specific)
technologies are:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Database</b> (DB2, Sybase, Oracle, other <b>SQL</b> databases - especially
if person can migrate data cross-platform).</li>

<li>
<b>Unix</b> OS (Solaris) - the most common operating system in financial
world</li>

<li>
<b>EAI</b> (Enterprise Application Integration) - CRM, ERP, etc. packages</li>

<li>
cross-platform integration experience</li>

<li>
<b>C++ / Java</b> (especially server side - trading systems, application
servers like WebLogic, WebSphere, Dynamo, iPlanet).</li>

<li>
<b>xml/xsl, SOAP</b></li>

<li>
<b>project-management</b>-oriented experience or certifications, <b>security</b>-oriented
experience or certifications</li>

<li>
Internet technologies (<b>HTML,Javascript, Perl/CGI</b>)</li>

<li>
<b>Financial</b> industry experience (talk the talk)</li>
</ul>

<p><br>Technology requirements are constantly changing.&nbsp; In 1999 anybody
who would say that he/she knows (or even just likes to learn) HTML would
be hired. After collapse of dot-coms in 2000, nobody is interested in HTML.&nbsp;
EAI (Enterprise Application Integration) is the king now (ERP, CRM, PRM,
etc.)
<p>Java was very hot in 2001, but today (Summer 2001) it dropped to the
level of Perl.
<br>C++ stays strong.
<p>I thought that <u>wireless technologies</u> would be in big demand (delivering
stock quotes to cellular phones and PDAs), but it is not happenning. At
least not on the market of big financial firms.&nbsp; Wireless is used
- but usually it comes as an extra feature with some sort of CRM or other
package that the company buys. So although there is some market for this
development - it is not a mainstream.&nbsp; May be situation will be different
in 2002 ?

<p>Big money is paid by big companies - especially financial. Dot-coms
come and go - but financial world stays hungry for brains. And it has money
to pay.
<center>
<p><b><font color="#990000">Target expensive software packages</font></b></center>

<p>Well, this advice definitely works, although it is not something I am
necessarily recommending or doing myself.&nbsp; The idea is, that if a
big company has just spent a million dollars (I've seen 30 mln / piece)
for the software license - they will pay handsomely to make it work.&nbsp;
The package may be an AS (Application Server), or an ERP (Enterprise Resource
Planning) system, or CRM (Customer Relationship Management), or a content
management system, or messaging system, a big enterprise-level database
(DB2), or something else. What the system actually does is not important.
Important is that the system is VERY EXPENSIVE.
<center>
<p><b><font color="#990000">Target new technologies</font></b></center>

<p>If the system is NEW, then there is almost no specialists available,
i.e. there is very low competition to you. You can easily land this job
if you just spend some time to learn this new technology.
<center>
<p><b><font color="#990000">Generally avoid technologies which are taught
everywhere</font></b></center>

<p>If technology is taught everywhere - chances are that it was on the
market long enough so that there is a lot of specialists available and
competition is tough.
<center>
<p><b><font color="#990000">The best, of course, may be to become a specialist
in a technology which is both NEW and EXPENSIVE.</font></b></center>

<p>But how to find a technology (package) like that?
<br>Well, it is easy.&nbsp; Just visit web sites of existing vendors of
expensive packages - and see if they have NEW EXPENSIVE products. Look
for this information in the news and reviews. Try talking to managers.&nbsp;
Pretty soon you will get several products to choose from.
<center>
<p><b><font color="#990000">Search for more development and less maintenance
in job descriptions.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#990000">Position yourself as an architect.</font></b></center>

<p><b><u>Development of new systems:</u></b>
<br>&nbsp; - is much more interesting and pleasant work than maintenance
of old systems.
<br>&nbsp; - it allows you to work with new interesting technologies and
improves your resume significantly.
<br>&nbsp; - it is less stressful than maintenance
<br>&nbsp; - it is paid much better.
<p><b><u>Maintenance:</u></b>
<br>&nbsp; - gives much less freedom in your work.
<br>&nbsp; - gives less chances to grow professionally.
<br>&nbsp; - is not exciting or interesting.&nbsp; You have to dig through
miles of somebody else's code without documentation and resolve production
problems. Plus you are always under pressure from clients. You spend too
much time to become a specialist in a particular implementation in a particular
department - a qualification which is of little use for other potential
clients.
<br>&nbsp; - is paid less than development.

<br>Many people are afraid of interviews, because they concentrate on what
can go wrong, questions they may not answer, etc.&nbsp; Then after the
interview they would worry that they said something wrong.&nbsp; Or, on
the contrary, expect to receive an offer because they said something right.&nbsp;
The truth is, you can't control whether you will get the job or not.

<p>As you see, it is very difficult to predict the results logically. And
statistically only one out of 10 or 20 (or more) interviews will result
in hiring.&nbsp; So most probably when you are going on the interview -
you will not be hired. It is not bad - it is just how the things are.
<p>So relax and don't think too much about one interview.&nbsp; Just schedule
many interviews.&nbsp; If you make 2 interviews daily (10 weekly, 40 in
a month) - you will get a job, simply because market is very hungry. It
can take several weeks.&nbsp; Or 1-2 months.&nbsp; May be more.&nbsp; It
is just statistical game.
<p>When you are going on the interview - don't think whether you will be
hired or not. Instead plan to use this interview for your own benefit.
How?
<center>
<p><b><font color="#990000">Interview is an opportunity to learn,</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#990000">to get training,</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#990000">to make new friends.</font></b></center>

<p>Just think about it.&nbsp; You will be interviewed for 30+ min by a
specialist in his field.&nbsp; Not by a trainer at computer courses, who
teaches because who can't do real work. No, you will speak with a real
professional.&nbsp; A person who was thinking about his project, technology,
different ways to proceed.&nbsp; And he/she will tell you (for FREE) what
their team is doing, why, what their plans are, what they are looking for.
If you take out your notepad and start writing this stuff - you will learn
a lot.&nbsp; Later at night you can go on the Internet, find all the subjects
he/she was talking about and review them.
<center>
<p><b><font color="#990000">This is free and very effective education.</font></b></center>

<p>After each interview you will grow.&nbsp; Good thing is that you get
this education regardless of whether you will be hired or not. After a
month going on interviews you will know all the buzz words.&nbsp; You will
learn to "talk the talk".&nbsp; It doesn't mean that you can "walk the
walk".&nbsp; But, at least, you can now present yourself much better.
<p>Also during the interview you will be asked to tell about yourself and
the projects you worked in. First time it may be difficult to find right
words - but after several interviews all the answers will become automatic.
<br><img SRC="images/dog_wang_tail.gif" height=142 width=112 align=RIGHT>
<br>Finally, it is <b><font color="#990000">very important to make good
exit</font></b>.&nbsp; Your goal is to convey the message that you would
like to work on this job.&nbsp; You should say that
<b><font color="#3333FF">you
like</font></b> the person, <b><font color="#3333FF">you like</font></b>
the team, <b><font color="#3333FF">you like</font></b> the project, <b><font color="#3333FF">you
like</font></b> the organization,
<b><font color="#3333FF">you like</font></b>
everything, and that you will be happy to work with them.&nbsp; <b><font color="#990000">You
should wang your tail like a dog</font></b>.
<p>Then you smile, shake hands - and leave.
<p><b><u>So, the results are:</u></b>
<br>&nbsp; - you have learnt something new
<br>&nbsp; - you've got training&nbsp; in selling yourself
<br>&nbsp; - you've got a chance (small) to be hired
<br>&nbsp; - you had good time and made new friend(s)
<p>When you get home - you send an email to the person who interviewed
you (you got it from him in the beginning, don't you?).&nbsp; You say again
how you like to work as part of his team.
<center>
<p><b><font color="#990000">Then you forget about this interview</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#990000">and don't worry about the results -</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#990000">just go on other interviews.</font></b></center>

<p>And one more thing:
<center>
<p><b><font color="#990000">Don't discuss money on the interview</font></b>
<br><font color="#990000"><b>(especially on the first interview)</b>.</font></center>

<p>Say that this is something they could discuss later (and they better
do it with your agent).&nbsp; Absolutely refuse to discuss this topic.
You can tell that you feel awkward discussing money before you know what
the job and responsibilities are, and before they made a decision whether
you are a good fit or not. You can tell that you know the market and you
want a competitive offer.&nbsp; You can tell that they (your potential
employer) probably are not interested in paying you too little (because
then they can't keep you for too long).&nbsp; And you understand that they
can't afford to pay you too much.&nbsp; So it should be reasonable market
value.&nbsp; But don't give any numbers - refer them to your agent.

<p>I was asked to write few words about this. It is funny, because I don't
have any problems surviving. I am getting several job offers every day.
And I know many people around me who increased their compensations despite
"hard times".
<p>Come on, guys. You are spoiled with the market. Think about insurance
sales agents. Do they receive calls every day offering them new orders?&nbsp;
Or what about accountants? Their market is tough, because it is old and
saturated, and now they have to compete with software packages and online
services.
<p>The market for programmers is much better. In fact, it continues to
be excellent. But you have to know how to approach it.
<p>Yes, it is true that companies have laid off lots of programmers and
rates in some areas went down. But this is something we should be expecting
and be prepared for.
<p>My principle is very simple:
<center>
<p><b><font color="#CC0000">"Quit before you get fired".</font></b></center>

<p>Let me explain.
<p><u>Here are 3 periods you will see all the time.</u>
<p><b><i><u><font color="#CC0000">PRE-period</font></u></i></b> - A technology
is is not widely accepted. Venture capital is not here yet.&nbsp; This
period may last for years and decades. The area may be interesting from
technology point of view, but salaries are not high.
<p><b><i><u><font color="#CC0000">FAST GROWTH</font></u></i></b> period
- everybody suddenly wants this technology. There is not enough specialists
on the market. There aren't enough books or training courses. Companies
are paying obscene money to get specialists - and still there are not enough
of them. Anybody who is breathing and mentions this technology in the resume
or simply tells that he wants to work in this direction will easily get
a job.
<p><b><i><u><font color="#CC0000">AFTER-period</font></u></i></b> - market
is flooded with specialists. Rates go down - and it is difficult to get
jobs even at those low rates, because the specialists have become a commodity.&nbsp;
There are ten courses advertised in every newspaper. There are countless
books on the subject. There are tens of magazines. There are software packages
allowing a 13 year old to do the job. There are web sites providing the
service at a very low rate.
<p>You want to be in the "<b>FAST GROWTH</b>" sector?. Sure. But how?
<p>The answer is, of course, very simple.
<p>You should expect that the <b>FAST GROWTH</b> period will end pretty
soon (~ 2 years max.).&nbsp; So you will have to change the specialization
- and become a specialist in another technology which will get into <b>FAST
GROWTH</b> next.&nbsp; You should do research of what will come next. You
should learn the technology in advance and position yourself so that when
the time comes - you are ready.
<p>You can either try to predict where to go next - or just closely follow
the market.&nbsp; It is difficult to predict, sometimes, but it is always
easy to follow the market - all you have to do is to ask simple questions,
for example:
<br>&nbsp; - what technologies seems to be in very high demand for this/next
year?
<br>&nbsp; - what technologies are very very well paid.
<br>&nbsp; - what new companies, groups or departments are being created?
(or planned to be created) - and what technologies?
<p>Don't limit yourself to just programming. Look at joins with other industries.&nbsp;

<p>Talk to agents. Talk to other specialists. Talk to managers. Read the
news. Follow the trends. Search the Internet. Learn new things. Constantly
invest in changing yourself and your definition as a specialist.
<p>Try to be on top of the market (or at least not far behind the market).
Quit BEFORE you are fired. Change your skin. Grow. Evolve.
<p>Good luck.
