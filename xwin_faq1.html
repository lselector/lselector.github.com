<H2><A name=1>1) What is the client-server model?</A></H2>A client is an 
application or program, such as a clock or a terminal emulator. A server acts as 
an intermediary between the client (application) and the display. It takes 
information from an input device, such as a mouse, and sends it to the client. 
It also takes information from the client and sends it to the graphics hardware.

</PRE>
<H2><A name=2>2) Explain the term "remote display"?</A></H2>Typically, a client 
and server run on the same workstation. Clients, however, can be run from other 
machines via a network (including machines with different operating systems and 
architecture). This allows you to run a compute-intensive program on one machine 
and render the results on your workstation screen. 
<H2><A name=3>3) How do I run a program on one machine and display it on 
another?</A></H2>The DISPLAY environment variable lets you specify the machine 
on which you want the X client to be displayed. You can specify the local 
machine in one of three ways : 
<DL>
  <DT>
  <DD>a) setenv DISPLAY :0 
  <DD>or 
  <DD>b) setenv DISPLAY localhost:0 
  <DD>or 
  <DD>c) setenv DISPLAY <I>yourhost</I>:0 where <I>yourhost</I> is your machine 
  name. </DD></DL>Similarly, you can specify a remote host: 
<DL>
  <DT>
  <DD>setenv DISPLAY <I>remotehost</I>:0 </DD></DL>
<H2><A name=4>4) Does the DISPLAY environment variable work for GL 
applications?</A></H2>Yes. GL programs display on the machine specified by the 
DISPLAY environment variable. This occurs because the GL now uses the 
Distributed Graphics Library (DGL) capabilities by default. It is important to 
remember that only Silicon Graphics' machines can displayGL. For networks 
running NIS (formerly yellow pages), it is important to add the compiler flag 
"-lsun". 
<H2><A name=5>5) The DISPLAY variable doesn't seem to work. 
Why?</A></H2>Sometimes, when trying to display to a remote server, you see these 
messages: "permission denied" or "can't connect to server" message. To solve 
permission problems, you need to disable access control on the remote server 
using the xhost command. This is the default behavior on Silicon Graphics' 
machines. If you have problems connecting to a server, check to make sure you 
used the correct ethernet addresses and the server is up and running. Where NIS 
is used, also make sure the client is linked with "-lsun". 
<H2><A name=6>6) What are resources?</A></H2>Basically, resources are 
"attributes" that control the look and feel of an application. Resources include 
color, fonts, size, location, and more. Resources can have a complex format for 
binding strengths. For a complete description of resources, including a 
description of "loose" and "tight" bindings, consult a book listed in the 
bibliography for <A 
href="http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/chemnet/general/aboutx.html#25">question 
#25</A>. 
<H2><A name=7>7) How do I set resources?</A></H2>There are many ways to set 
resources. Resources may be listed in files or contained in a data base. It is 
recommended that you consult a Book on X as well as the man page for "xrdb" for 
detailed descriptions. Generally speaking, if xrdb is not used, resource files 
are specified through environment variables. <A 
href="http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/chemnet/general/aboutx.html#14">Question 
#14</A> addresses the precedence of these files and variables. 
<P>For some examples, see the file /usr/tutor/Customize/example.Xdefaults. 
<H2><A name=8>8) How do I know what resources I can set for an 
application?</A></H2>The most common place to find resource variables for a 
particular application is in the man page for that application. 
<P>For example, take a look at the man page for `xwsh'. Look for the section 
heading called `RESOURCES'. This section lists each resource for `xwsh', and in 
some cases, the valid values for that resource. 
<P>Also, many major applications are built on top of the Xt toolkit. There are 
standard resources that these applications recognize. For a more complete 
description, see one of the books on Xt listed in the bibliography. 
<H2><A name=9>9) How do I run the same program twice with different 
attributes?</A></H2>To accomplish this task, you need to take advantage of the 
"instance vs class" concept. This concept is explained further in most books on 
Xt. 
<P>Many applications have a resource that lets you to give it a unique name. For 
example, from the xwsh man page : 
<DL>
  <DT>-name instance-name 
  <DD>Provide a unique name for an xwsh window. This name becomes the instance 
  name of the specific xwsh, with the class name always being "XWsh". 
</DD></DL>Using the -name option allows you to give "names" to different 
instances of xwsh and assign different resources to each one. So if you want two 
different xwsh's with different resource sets, give them two different names, 
say howdymom and howdydoody, for example. Add the following to your ~/.Xdefaults 
file (if you use .Xdefaults) : 
<DL>
  <DT>
  <DD>howdymom*foreground: SeaGreen 
  <DD>howdydoody*foreground: SGIBeet </DD></DL>
<DL>
  <DT>Now all you have to do is start them up : 
  <DD>xwsh -name howdymom&amp; 
  <DD>xwsh -name howdydoody&amp; </DD></DL>
<H2><A name=10>10) Does the GL recognize resources now?</A></H2>Yes. For 
complete information see the man page for GLRESOURCES. Here is the beginning of 
the man page : 
<P>GLRESOURCES(3G) Silicon Graphics GLRESOURCES(3G) 
<P>
<DL>
  <DT>NAME 
  <DD>GL Resources - X resources used by GL programs 
  <P></P>
  <DT>DESCRIPTION 
  <DD>In IRIX 4.0 and later, the GL responds to several X resources, allowing 
  run-time control over some aspects of GL programs. 
  <P></P>
  <DD>This man page assumes you are somewhat familiar with X resources, if you 
  are not, you should read some X documentation such as Volume 3 of the <A 
  href="http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/chemnet/general/oreilly.html">O'Reilly X 
  books</A>. 
  <P></P>
  <DD>The GL uses resources names with the prefixes 
  <DL>
    <DT>
    <DD>appname.gl. (instance prefix) 
    <DD>Appname.GL. (class prefix) </DD></DL>
  <DD>where appname and Appname are derived from the argument to the GL 
  program's first call to winopen(3G) upper case. </DD></DL>
<H2><A name=11>11) How do I find out what fonts are available?</A></H2>The 
xfontsel and xlsfonts utilities help you find appropriate fonts. xlsfonts lists 
the fonts; xfontsel provides an interface for selecting a desired font. To use 
xfontsel, choose "Font Names" from the Customization rollover menu in the 
Toolchest. Please see the man pages and the IRIS Utilities Guide for further 
information. 
<H2><A name=12>12) Does Silicon Graphics provide any tools to help with the 
customization process?</A></H2>Yes. The Customization rollover menu in the 
Toolchest contains three entries: Window Info, Color Names, and Font Names. 
Please refer to the man pages on these commands for details: xfontsel, xlsfonts, 
xwininfo, xdpyinfo, xprop, appres, listres, and xrdb. 
<P>Also, see the "WorkSpace User's Guide" and the example files in 
/usr/tutor/Customize. 
<H2><A name=13>13) What is a good approach to take in looking for 
resources?</A></H2>The following is a recommended list of steps to take when 
searching for a resource, binding, behavior, etc. 
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>Look in the 4.0 Transition Guide. 
  <LI>Look in /usr/tutor/Customize. 
  <LI>Look in /usr/demos. 
  <LI>Look in ~4Dgifts. (Available with the development option.) 
  <LI>If the client you are interested in is a GL client, see the man page for 
  GLRESOURCES. 
  <LI>Look in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/ClientName. 
  <LI>Look in /usr/lib/X11/system.* . 
  <LI>Look through the man page for the client you are interested in. 
  <LI>Look in <A 
  href="http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/chemnet/general/oreilly.html">O'Reilly 
  &amp; Associates</A> Vol. III. It has many gems pertaining to standard X 
  clients. 
  <LI>Look in the documentation that came with your application. 
  <LI>Look in the OSF Motif manuals. 
  <LI>Post to comp.windows.x if you can not find an answer using steps 1 through 
  11. </LI></OL>
<H2><A name=14>14) What is the precedence for resource files?</A></H2>The 
following list indicates the weight of set resources. Items at the top have the 
greatest weight. 
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>Hard coded values for resources. 
  <LI>Command line arguments. 
  <LI>Resources pointed to by $XENVIRONMENT. 
  <LI>Resource values loaded into the Resource Data Base via xrdb. 
  <LI>Resources pointed to by other environment variables : 
  <P>
  <DL>
    <DT>IF $XUSERFILESEARCHPATH is set 
    <DD>then it contains a list of directories to search. 
    <P></P>
    <DT>ELSE IF $XAPPLRESDIR is set 
    <DD>it contains a single directory, and a short list of related directories 
    (e.g. adjusted for language) is where resource files must be found. 
    <P></P>
    <DT>ELSE 
    <DD>Look in a short list of places related to $HOME (e.g. language 
    adjusted). This includes files in $HOME that have the name of the class of 
    the application. </DD></DL>
  <LI>Resource values set in $HOME/.Xdefaults, provided that the 
  RESOURCE_MANAGER property hasn't been set via the xrdb command. (see the third 
  paragraph in the xrdb man page) 
  <LI>Values set in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/*. 
  <LI>Values set through through the application's fall back mechanism. </LI></OL>
<H2><A name=15>15) What files affect the window manager and what is their 
relationship to each other?</A></H2>
<OL>
  <LI>~/.4Dwmrc, if you have one 
  <LI>/usr/lib/X11/system.4Dwmrc 
  <LI>/usr/bin/X11/4Dwm 
  <LI>/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/4Dwm 
  <LI>~/.Xdefaults (or wherever you set resources) </LI></OL>
<P>When 4Dwm is started, it looks for ~/.4Dwmrc. If it does not exist, it looks 
at /usr/lib/X11/system.4Dwmrc. The definitions for button bindings, menus, etc 
are contained in these files. For a better description of bindings, look in 
/usr/tutor/Customize/example.4Dwmrc and /usr/people/4Dgifts/.4Dwmrc. Also see 
the man pages for 4Dwm. 
<P>The resource set for the bindings will actually "choose" which binding 
definition is set. 
<H2><A name=16>16) Do I need my own .4Dwmrc file?</A></H2>Not necessarily. As 
mentioned in the previous question, actual bindings are determined by resource 
names. If there is a binding definition in /usr/lib/X11/system.4Dwmrc that you 
like, you may choose it by setting the appropriate resource. 
<H2><A name=17>17) Can I run different window managers?</A></H2>In Irix 4D1-4.0, 
you may choose 4Dwm, mwm, twm, or uwm. Note that GL programs are guaranteed to 
work only under 4Dwm. 
<H2><A name=18>18) How do I choose a different window manager as the 
default?</A></H2>To use another window manager at login time, you must use a 
.xsession file. Please see <A 
href="http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/chemnet/general/aboutx.html#21">question 
#21.</A> 
<H2><A name=19>19) Where can I learn more about the Window Manager 
behavior?</A></H2>The man pages for 4Dwm and mwm contain a wealth of information 
on the window manager. There are also online files. You may want to read 
/usr/tutor/Customize/example.4Dwmrc as well as /usr/people/4Dgifts/.4Dwmrc (if 
you have the IDO option). The OSF/Motif manuals listed in the bibliography are 
also good places to find information. (4Dwm is based on mwm). 
<H2><A name=20>20) How do I recover from a failed customization 
attempt?</A></H2>If your attempt at customization leaves you in a state where 
buttons and menus are no longer recognized, you can recover by pressing the 
&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;CTRL&gt;&lt;Shift&gt;&lt;!&gt; keys simultaneously. A menu 
appears that will let you choose Motif, Iris, or user defaults. Choose either 
Motif or Iris defaults and then push OK. This restarts the window manager to a 
usable state. 
<H2><A name=21>21) What is the difference between .xsession and 
.sgisession?</A></H2>From the login event sequence mentioned earlier, you will 
note that /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession tries to exec $HOME/.xsession if it exists. 
This is how you would go about changing programs started by default. An example 
is the start of the window manager. There is a discussion on xsession files in 
volume 3 of the <A 
href="http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/chemnet/general/oreilly.html">O'Reilly 
series</A>. For examples of alternate xsession files look at 
/usr/people/4Dgifts/.xsession or /usr/demos/.xsession. 
<P>If you don't have a $HOME/.xsession file, /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession starts 
things for you and eventually looks for $HOME/.sgisession. This is a good way to 
start additional programs without changing what is started by default. 
<H2><A name=22>22) After copying /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession to .xsession, I can't 
login.</A></H2>After copying this file to your home directory, you need to 
remove all references to "xsession". References to xsession cause the system to 
try to execute $HOME/.xsession, which will create an infinite loop. 
<H2><A name=23>23) What are the important login and resource files for IRIX 
4D1-4.0?</A></H2>The following three file groupings indicate where files that 
affect your login session reside. 
<P>1) /usr/lib/X11/* - This is THE starting place. Here you find the system 
default bindings for Motif, 4Dwm, and the Toolchest. The xdm directory lives 
here as well as the app-defaults directory. xdm controls the session management. 
Many application defaults are set in the app-defaults directory. 
<P>2) $HOME/[.Xdefaults, .4Dwmrc, .chestrc, .xsession, .sgisession] - Here you 
find the files that control your system set-up. You create these files; they 
don't exist when you first log in. 
<P>3) /usr/bin/X11 - This is where the binaries live. It makes life nice to 
include this directory in your path. 
<H2><A name=24>24) What is the sequence of events that occur at login 
time?</A></H2>This is a bare bones synopsis of the events that occur when you 
log in to the console via xdm (xdm is the default method of logging in). 
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>Provide a "failsafe" (nographics) login if required/requested. 
  <LI>Exec $HOME/.xsession if it exists. If it exists, the remaining steps 
  should normally be included in the users .xsession file as well. 
  <LI>Load $HOME/.Xresources if it exists. 
  <LI>Set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH. 
  <LI>Incorporate a "shell" environment into the "session". (man userenv) 
  <LI>Set the root background and cursor. 
  <LI>Start 4Dwm. 
  <LI>Wait for 4Dwm to come up. 
  <LI>Disable display access control (xhost +). (man xhost) 
  <LI>Execute $HOME/.sgisession if it exists. 
  <LI>Start WorkSpace if the user wants it. 
  <LI>Put a Toolchest on each screen. 
  <LI>Start the console. 
  <LI>Exec the "reaper". (man reaper / endsession) </LI></OL>
