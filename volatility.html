  <p>Naive estimates:<br>
Estimate volatility: &sigma;<sup>2</sup> = (1/N)(1/dt)<strong>&Sigma;</strong>R<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup> , where R -return of i-th asset.<br>
Problem with this - too much memory (picks look like plateaus).<br>
Better - use exponentially-weighted moving average estimate with parameter &lambda;.</p>

  <p>short term - volatility dominates, long term - drift dominates</p>
<p>- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_smile">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_smile</a> - the volatility smile is a long-observed pattern in which at-the-money options tend to have lower implied volatilities than in- or out-of-the-money options. The pattern displays different characteristics for different markets and results from the probability of extreme moves. Equity options traded in American markets did not show a volatility smile before the Crash of 1987 but began showing one afterwards.</p>
  <p>Modelling the volatility smile is an active area of research in quantitative finance. Typically, a quantitative analyst will calculate the implied volatility from liquid vanilla options and use models of the smile to calculate the price of more exotic options.</p>
  <p>A closely related concept is that of term structure of volatility, which refers to how implied volatility differs for related options with different maturities. An implied volatility surface is a 3-D plot that combines volatility smile and term structure of volatility into a consolidated view of all options for an underlier.</p>

  <p><span class="style1">implied volatility</span> - the value of volatility which makes the model price to fit the current market price. i.e.  if you use it in a particular pricing model, the price of the option predicted by this model should be the same as the current market price.</p>

        If we imply a BS model where &sigma; = const, and have S, X, r, (T-t), and current V - then we can compute implied volatility using iterative procedure (we can't simply invert the formulas).<br>
        In real life &sigma; for options is different for different expirations and different strike prices:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;      &sigma; = &sigma;(t,S).<br>
        Thus surfaces are used.<br>

        <p>Two ways to do estimates:</p>
        <p>1. from actual historical volatility -&gt; to implied volatlity<br>
          2. from implied volatility -&gt; to local volatility.</p>
        <p>For second approach Paul Wilmott has derived a formula (assuming that there is continuous market data on V=V(S,T)). The resulting expression gives big errors for far in/out the money options (because both numerator and denominator become small). To reduce errors, he provides another formula deducing local volatility from implied volatility.</p>
        <p>In practice we have a limited set of descretely-spaced call prices. Thus the surface for implied/local volatility is presented by a set of dots. We fit this set with a surface using some model (parametrization) and some fitting procedure. A simple model: </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&sigma;<sub>imp</sub>(E,T) = a(T)(E-S<sup>*</sup>) + b(T)</p>

<p class="sectionheader">Interest Rate Volatility  and Stock Return and Volatility</p>
<p>When interest rates go up - people tend to deposit their 
savings in bank accounts rather than investing in stock market. Also the profitability of firms decreases (because they have to pay higher interests on their loans) - thus stock prices go down. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>market returns and variance parameters are very close to<br>
  each other for both the models. Conditional market returns have a negatively significant relation with<br>
  the interest rates as in USA and Korea. Thus we can easily predict the stock returns by analyzing<br>
  interest rates. At the same time, conditional variance is also negatively related to interest rates however<br>
  this relationship is insignificant. This implies that interest rates have a weak predictive power for<br>
  volatility.<br>
  It is generally accepted that with an increase in interest rates people tend to deposit their<br>
  savings in bank accounts rather than investing in stock market. Also it reduces the profitability of firms<br>
  and thus stock prices go down. As interest rate in economy is determined by monetary policy of that<br>
  country, policy makers should concentrate on it for adjusting the volume of stock market and over all<br>
investments in economy.</p>
