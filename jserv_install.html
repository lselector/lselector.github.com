How to install Apache JServ on win32 systems</h1></center>

<h3>
Introduction</h3>
This section guides you through the installation process for win32 systems
in the case you didn't use the self-installation <i>typical</i> mode or
in case you did so but something went wrong and you choose the <i>custom</i>
installation which doesn't automatically connect Apache JServ with the
Apache Web Server.
<h3>
Requirements</h3>
The following requirements exist for building Apache JServ:
<ul>
<li>
<b><u>Disk Space</u></b></li>

<p><br>The complete Apache JServ installation requires less than 2Mb of
hard disk space. The compiled, not-compressed jar archive is more or less
100Kb.
<li>
<b><u>Apache HTTP Server</u></b></li>

<p><br>Apache JServ works only with the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache
HTTP Server</a> 1.3.1 or higher. (latest version is highly recommended).
<li>
<b><u>Java Runtime Environment</u></b></li>

<p><br>A fully compliant Java 1.1 Runtime Environment is required for Apache
JServ to execute. The official <a href="http://java.sun.com/cgi-bin/java-ports.cgi">list
of compatible ports</a> is found on the JavaSoft web site.
<p><b>Note:</b> since Apache JServ uses <u>only</u> standard Java APIs
(<tt>java.*</tt>), please, do not submit a bug report if your Java virtual
machine fails to execute Apache JServ because of broken compliance. Send
it to your Java virtual machine implementers.
<li>
<b><u>Java Servlet Development Kit 2.0</u></b></li>

<p><br>The JavaSoft JSDK 2.0 is required by Apache JServ for proper servlet
execution. This package is freely available from the JavaSoft web site
(<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/index.html" target="_top">http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/index.html</a>)
<p><b>Note:</b> this version of Apache JServ requires <u>exactly</u> the
specified version of the JSDK in order to operate properly. Any other version
(past, present or future) is not supported.
<li>
<b><u>Java Compiler</u></b></li>

<p><br>Since the distribution include the precompiled Java binary archive,
compilation of the Java source is optional.
<p><b>Note</b>: a Java compiler is needed to build servlets if you plan
to write your own.
<li>
<b><u>C Compiler</u></b></li>

<p><br>Even if win32 distribution comes with precompiled binaries, the
mod_jserv module and the native wrapper need a C compiler in order to operate
correctly. Currently only Microsoft Visual C++ (version 5.0 or higher)
is supported.</ul>

<h3>
Overview</h3>
The Apache JServ servlet engine is composed by two main parts, the servlet
engine server application (written in 100% pure Java) and the web server
module (mod_jserv, written in C). This module is communication layer that
allows the web server to request servlets to the servlet engine.
<p>Even if many different ways of installing Apache JServ exist, in this
section we concentrate to the basic installation (called integrated or
automatic mode) where the servlet engine process is spawned and controlled
by the web server itself and, consequently, both the web server and the
servlet engine share the same system resources.
<p>This document assumes you have your Apache Web Server already installed
and configured.
<h3>
Installing the servlet engine</h3>
The servlet engine is a 100% pure Java server application with its own
configuration files. jserv.properties is the main configuration file while
zone.properties is an example servlet zone configuration file (see the
<a href="jserv_servlets.html">servlet zone howto</a> for more info on servlet
zones). You need to edit a few directives in the jserv.properties file
to let the JVM spawner (either the module or the wrapper) where to find
things.
<p>These are the properties you should edit:
<blockquote>
<pre>wrapper.bin=@JAVA@ (the name of the JVM interpreter, absolute if not in PATH)</pre>

<pre>wrapper.classpath=@JSERV_CLASSES@ (the path to ApacheJServ.jar)
wrapper.classpath=@JSDK_CLASSES@ (the path to jsdk.jar)</pre>

<pre>root.properties=@ZONE_CONF@ (the path to ./conf/zone.properties)</pre>

<pre>log.file=@JSERV_LOG@ (the path to ./logs/jserv.log)</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Installing the web server module</h3>
The Apache web server communicates with the servlet engine using the Apache
JServ module named ApacheModuleJServ.dll (found in the \bin\c directory
of the distribution). This file must be copied under the \modules directory
of your existing Apache installation.
<p>After you have copied the file in the module directory, you should append
the configuration template file \conf\httpd.conf to your existing Apache
configuration file (usually httpd.conf). This template helps you configure
the module and the web server.
<p>The first thing to do is to uncomment the loadmodule directive to let
Apache know about the new module
<blockquote>
<pre># Tell Apache on win32 to load the Apache JServ communication module
LoadModule jserv_module modules/ApacheModuleJServ.dll</pre>
</blockquote>
After this, you should specify the servlet engine configuration file (usually
jserv.properties) and the module log file with the directives
<blockquote>
<pre>ApJServProperties &lt;full path to ./conf/jserv.properties>
ApJServLogFile &lt;full path to ./logs/jserv.module.log></pre>
</blockquote>
The log file will be created if not existing or logs will be appended to
an existing file.
<h3>
Checking the installation</h3>
You are ready to test your Apache JServ installation: simply run the Apache
Web Server and request the URL <a href="http://127.0.0.1/jserv/" target="_top">http://127.0.0.1/jserv/</a>.
<p>If the web server returns a File not found error code, this means that
your module is not properly installed or that you disabled the <a href="jserv_status.html">jserv-status
handler</a>. Otherwise you see the dynamic Apache JServ configuration pages
that show you the status of your servlet environment.
<p>The page you are seeing is created by the ApacheModuleJServ.dll module.
To see if the servlet engine is working, go to the servlet engine section
and follow the link. If everything is successful, you see the dynamic page
generated by Apache JServ showing his configurations, otherwise, if you
get an internal server error, this means your servlet engine is not working.
<h3>
Troubleshooting</h3>
If you get an internal server error while connecting to the servlet engine,
you should check your log files for problems.
<p>If the <i>jserv.log</i> file was not created this means that Apache
JServ did not even start. Usually this is due to a dirty or broken <i>classpath</i>
passed to the spawned virtual machine. Check out the <i>jserv.module.log</i>
file and the Apache <i>error.log</i> file for clues on what the problem
is. Just to make sure, you could try using absolute paths instead of relative
ones because the different processes may see different working directories.
<p>When the classpath is correct and Apache JServ starts, the <i>jserv.log</i>
file is created. Look at that file for description of eventual other problems.
<h3>
Installing servlets</h3>
After your servlet engine is up and running, you need to install your servlets.
To do this you need to learn about <a href="jserv_servlets.html">servlet
zones and their usage</a>. Later on, more advanced users may want to learn
<a href="jserv_security.html">how to secure their servlets</a> and servlet
engines.
