<P>
  This is my mock Exam No 3 based on the
Objectives for the Sun Java Programmers 
  Exam. It was created by Marcus Green and
may be freely distributed so long as 
  it is unmodified. Please email me if you
have any corrections or comments. </P>

<H3>How does this compare with the real thing?</H3>

<P>As of 5 Oct 200 the question format has changed
very slightly. You will now get more questions
that include snippets of code. My other two mock exams contain more code based
questions than this one.  Each question
will also tell you how many of the options
you need to pick. You can read more about
these revisions at <A href="http://www.jchq.net/faq/ExamUpdate.htm">http://www.jchq.net/faq/ExamUpdate.htm</A>. You should assume that the real thing will
be harder though many people have told me
that they get similar marks in the real thing
to my exams</P>
<h3>How to ask a question about this exam</h3>
<p>You can post a message on the discussion forum at <a href="http://www.jchq.net/discus">http://www.jchq.net/discus</a> 
  (scroll down the messages to find the create new conversation button). You could 
  also send me your question at <a href="mailto:questions@jchq.net">questions@jchq.net</a> but I get heaps of email and my answer is
likely to be slow and brief.</p>
<H3> It really does come with answers</H3>

<P>This is a long document (around 35 pages),
if you cannot see the answers then you have
not got the entire document, try reloading
it until you can see the answer to the final
question and the words &quot;End of document&quot;.
The answers contain references to approximately
which objective the question relates to.
If you have a query about any of these questions,
please, please include the full answer with
the question. You can jump back from an answer
to the question by pressing the back button

You can find the size of an array using the length field. The method

<I>length</I> is used to return the number of characters in a String. An array

can contain elements of any type but they must all be of the same type. The

size of an array is fixed at creation. If you want to change its size you can

of course create a new array and assign the old one to it. A more flexible

approach can be to use a collection class such as Vector. </P>

<P>3) Create and employee class with fields for Job title and fields for the

other values. </P>

<P>These questions can appear tricky as the whole business of designing class

structures is more art than science. It is asking you to decide if an item of

data is best represented by the &quot;Is a&quot; or &quot;Has a&quot;

relationship. Thus in this case any of the job titles mentioned will always

refer to something that &quot;Is a&quot; employee. However the employee

&quot;has a&quot; job title that might change. </P>

<P>One of the important points is to ask yourself when creating a class &quot;Could 
  this change into another class at some point in the future&quot;. Thus in this 
  example an apprentice chef would hope one day to turn into a chef and if she 
  is very good will one day be head chef. Few other mock exams seem to have this 
  type of questions but they di come up in the real exam.</P>

<P>3) new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new

FileInputStream(&quot;file.name&quot;)));</P>

<P>The key to this question is that it asks about tens of megabytes of data, implying 
  that performance is an issue. A Buffered Reader will optimise the performance 
  of accessing a file. Although the objectives do not specifically mention it 
  questions on I/O do come up on the exam.</P>

<P>4) Output of 0</P>

<P>The method fermin only receives a copy of the variable i and any modifications 
  to it are not reflected in the version in the calling method. The post increment 
  operator ++ effectivly modifes the value of i after the initial value has been 
  assiged to the left hand side of the equals operator. This can be a very tricky 
  conept to understand</P>

Objective 2.2)</P>

<P>1) Compile time error</P>

<P>This might be considered a &quot;gocha&quot; or deliberate attempt to mislead 
  you because i has been given the data type of long and the parameter must be 
  either a byte, char, short or int. If you attempt to compile this code with 
  JDK 1.2 you will get an error that says something like &quot;Incompatible type 
  for switch, Explicit cast needed to convert long to int. Answering with option 
  2 would have been reasonable because if the parameter had been an integer type 
  the lack of break statements would have caused this output. If you gave either 
  of the answers you should probably revise the subject.</P>

<P>1) System.out.println(i++); <BR>

3) System.out.println(i);<BR>

4) System.out.println(i--);</P>

<P>The options for this question might look suspiciously easy if you are not

aware of the effects of the post-increment operators. The ++ and -- operations

for examples 1 and 4 only come into effect after the output operations, ie

after whatever else is done to them on that line of code. Option 2 should be

fairly obvious as you should know that the single quote characters indicate a

char value, ie storing the character rather than the numberical value for 0.

<P>4) System.out.println( ((Agg) a).getFields());</P>
<P>The Base type reference to the instance of the class Agg needs to be cast from 
  Base to Agg to get access to its methods.The method invoked depends on the object 
  itself, not on the declared type. So, a.getField() invokes getField() in the 
  Base class, which displays Base. But the call to ((Agg)a).getField() will invoke 
  the getField() in the Agg class. You will be unlucky to get a question as complex 
  as this on the exam.</P>

  4) The time of a MouseEvent can be extracted using the when parameter of the 
  MouseEvent constructor </P>
<P>If you chose option 4, referring to the mythical getTime method you have made 
  a reasonable guess based on the normal conventions of Java. However the conventions 
  do not always hold true. If you chose option 3 perhaps you are not as aware 
  of the conventions as you should be.</P>
