<h2>
<a NAME="Fundamental Patterns"></a>Fundamental Design Patterns</h2>

<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;<a NAME="Delegation"></a><b>Delegation (When not to use Inheritance)</b></li>

<br>Delegation is a way of extending and reusing a class by writing another
class with additional functionality that uses instances of the original
class to provide the original functionality.</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<a NAME="Interface"></a><b>Interface</b></li>

<br>Keep a class that uses data and services provided by instances of other
classes independent of those classes by having it access those instances
through an interface.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Delegation">Delegation</a></li>

<br>The Delegation and Interface patterns are often used together.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Immutable"></a><b>Immutable</b></li>

<br>The Immutable pattern increases the robustness of objects that share
references to the same object and reduces the overhead of concurrent access
to an object. It accomplishes this by not allowing an object’s state information
to change after it is constructed. The Immutable pattern also avoids the
need to synchronize multiple threads of execution that share an object.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;<a href="#Single Threaded Execution">Single Threaded Execution</a></li>

<br>The Single Threaded Execution pattern is the pattern most frequently
used to coordinate access by multiple threads to a shared object. The Immutable
object pattern can be used to avoid the need for the Single Threaded Execution
pattern or any other kind of access coordination.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Marker Interface"></a><b>Marker Interface</b></li>

<br>The Marker Interface pattern uses interfaces that declare no methods
or variables to indicate semantic attributes of a class. It works particularly
well with utility classes that must determine something about objects without
assuming they are an instance of any particular class.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Snapshot">Snapshot</a></li>

<br>The Marker Interface pattern is used as part of the Snapshot pattern
to allow serialization of objects.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Proxy"></a><b>Proxy</b></li>

<br>The Proxy pattern forces method calls to an object to occur indirectly
through a proxy object that acts as a surrogate for the other object, delegating
method calls to that object. Classes for proxy objects are declared in
a way that usually eliminates client object’s awareness that they are dealing
with a proxy. Proxy is a very general pattern that occurs in many other
patterns, but never by itself in its pure form.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
Access Proxy</li>

<br>The Access Proxy pattern uses a proxy to enforce a security policy
on access to a service providing object.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Facade">Fa&ccedil;ade</a></li>

<br>The Fa&ccedil;ade pattern uses a single object as a front end to a
set of interrelated objects.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Remote Proxy</li>

<br>The Remote Proxy pattern uses a proxy to hide the fact that a service
object is located on a different machine than the client objects that want
to use it.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Virtual Proxy">Virtual Proxy</a></li>

<br>This pattern uses a proxy to create the illusion that a service providing
object exists before it has actually been created. It is useful if the
object is expensive to create and its services may not be needed.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Decorator">Decorator</a></li>

<br>The Decorator pattern is structurally similar to the Proxy pattern
in that it forces access to a service providing object to be done indirectly
through another object. The difference is a matter of intent. Instead of
trying to manage the service, the indirection object in some way enhances
the service.</ul>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<a NAME="Creational Patterns"></a>Creational Patterns</h2>

<li>
<a NAME="Abstract Factory"></a><b>Abstract Factory</b></li>

<br>Given a set of related abstract classes, the Abstract Factory pattern
provides a way to create instances of those abstract classes from a matched
set of concrete subclasses. The Abstract Factory pattern is useful for
allowing a program to work with a variety of complex external entities
such as different windowing systems with similar functionality.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Factory Method">Factory Method</a></li>

<br>The Abstract Factory may uses the Factory Method pattern.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Singleton">Singleton</a></li>

<br>Concrete Factory classes are usually implemented as Singleton classes.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Builder"></a><b>Builder</b></li>

<br>The Builder pattern allows a client object to construct a complex object
by specifying only its type and content. The client is shielded from the
details of the object’s construction.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Interface">Interface</a></li>

<br>The Builder pattern uses the Interface pattern to hide the actual class
of the object it builds.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Composite">Composite</a></li>

<br>The object built using the Builder pattern is typically a Composite.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Factory Method">Factory Method</a></li>

<br>The Builder pattern uses the Factory Method pattern to decide which
concrete class to instantiate to build the desired type of object.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Layered Initialization">Layered Initialization</a></li>

<br>The Builder pattern uses the Layered Initialization pattern to create
objects that build the desired type of object.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Null Object">Null Object</a></li>

<br>The Null Object pattern may be used by the Builder pattern to provide
“do nothing” implementations of methods.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Visitor">Visitor</a></li>

<br>The Visitor pattern allows the creation requesting object to be more
closely coupled to the construction of the new complex object. Instead
of describing the content of the objects to be built through a series of
method calls, the information is presented in bulk as a complex data structure.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Factory Method"></a><b>Factory Method</b></li>

<br>You write a class for reuse with arbitrary data types. You organize
this class so that it can instantiate other classes without being dependent
on any of the classes it instantiates. The reusable class is able to remain
independent of the classes it instantiates by it can delegatinge the choice
of which class to instantiate to another object and referring to the newly
created object through a common interface.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Abstract Factory">Abstract Factory</a></li>

<br>The Factory Method pattern is useful for constructing individual objects
for a specific purpose without the construction requester knowing the specific
classes being instantiated. If you need to create a matched set of such
objects, then the Abstract Factory pattern is a more appropriate pattern.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Template">Template Method</a></li>

<br>The Factory Method pattern is often used with the Template Method pattern.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Prototype">Prototype</a></li>

<br>The Prototype pattern provides an alternate way for an object to work
with other objects without knowing the details of their construction.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Prototype"></a><b>Prototype</b></li>

<br>The Prototype pattern allows an object to create customized objects
without knowing their class or any details of how to create them. It works
by giving prototypical objects to an object that initiates object creation.
The creation initiating object then creates objects by asking the prototypical
objects to make copies of themselves.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Composite">Composite</a></li>

<br>The Prototype pattern is often used with the Composite pattern. Prototypical
objects are often composite objects.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Abstract Factory">Abstract Factory</a></li>

<br>The Abstract Factory pattern can be a good alternative to the Prototype
pattern if there is no need for the dynamic changes that the Prototype
pattern allows to a palette of prototypical objects.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Facade">Fa&ccedil;ade</a></li>

<br>The class that manages a collection of prototypical objects commonly
acts as fa&ccedil;ade that separates the other classes that participate
in the Prototype pattern from the rest of the program.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Factory Method">Factory Method</a></li>

<br>The Factory Method pattern may be an alternative to the Prototype pattern
when the palette of prototypical objects never contains more than one object.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Decorator">Decorator</a></li>

<br>The Prototype pattern is often used with the Decorator pattern.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Singleton"></a><b>Singleton</b></li>

<br>The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is
created. All objects that use an instance of that class use the same instance.
<p>You can use the Singleton pattern with many other patterns. In particular,
it is often used with the <a href="#Abstract Factory">Abstract Factory</a>,
<a href="#Builder">Builder</a>
and <a href="#Prototype">Prototype</a> patterns.
<p>The Singleton pattern has some similarity to the <a href="#Cache Management">Cache
Management</a> pattern. A Singleton is functionally similar to a Cache
that only contains one object.
<p>If multiple threads will be getting the instance of a singleton class,
you can use the <a href="pattern_synopses2.htm#Double Checked Locking">Double
Checked Locking</a> coding pattern to ensure that only one instance is
created while avoiding the overhead of unnecessary thread synchronization
after the instance is created.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses3.htm#Shared Object">Shared Object</a></li>

<br>The Singleton pattern describes classes that have a single instance
that may or may not be shared. The Shared Object pattern describes objects
that are shared and may have multiple instances.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Object Pool"></a><b>Object Pool</b></li>

<br>Manage the reuse of objects for a type of object that is expensive
to create or only a limited number of a kind of object can be created.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Cache Management">Cache Management</a></li>

<br>The Cache Management pattern manages the reuse of specific instances
of a class. The Object Pool pattern manages and creates instances of a
class that can be used interchangeably.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Factory Method">Factory Method</a></li>

<br>The Factory Method pattern can be used to encapsulate the creation
logic for objects. However, it does not manage them after their creation.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Singleton">Singleton</a></li>

<br>Objects that manage object pools are usually singletons.</ul>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<a NAME="Partitioning Patterns"></a>Partitioning Patterns</h2>

<li>
<a NAME="Layered Initialization"></a><b>Layered Initialization</b></li>

<br>When you need multiple implementations of an abstraction, you usually
define a class to encapsulate common logic and subclasses to encapsulate
different specialized logic. That does not work when common logic must
be used to decide which specialized subclass to create. The Layered Initialization
pattern solves this problem by encapsulating the common and specialized
logic to create an object in unrelated classes.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Builder">Builder</a></li>

<br>The Builder pattern uses the Layered Initialization pattern to create
a specialized object for representing data in a specific form.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Facade">Fa&ccedil;ade</a></li>

<br>The Layered Initialization pattern uses the Fa&ccedil;ade pattern by
hiding all of the other objects participating in the pattern from clients
of service objects.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Factory Method">Factory Method</a></li>

<br>When the choice of which kind of object to create does not involve
any significant preprocessing of data, the Factory Method pattern may be
a better choice. The Layered Initialization pattern may use the Factory
Method pattern after it has decided what kind of specialized logic is needed.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Layered Initialization">Layered Initialization</a></li>

<br>The Layered Initialization pattern recognizes a division of responsibilities
into layers during design.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Composite">Composite</a></li>

<br>When more than two layers of initialization are needed for initialization
you can combine the Layered Initialization pattern with the Composite pattern
to perform initialization in as many layers as needed.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Filter"></a><b>Filter</b></li>

<br>The Filter pattern allows objects that perform different transformations
and computations on streams of data and have compatible interfaces to be
dynamically connected to perform combinations of operations on streams
of data.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Composite">Composite</a></li>

<br>The Composite pattern can be an alternative to the Filter pattern when
the objects involved do not have a consistent interface and they can be
composed statically.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Layered Architecture</li>

<br>The Layered Architecture pattern (described in volume 2) is similar
to the Filter pattern. The most important difference is that the objects
involved in the layered Architecture pattern correspond to different levels
of abstraction.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Decorator">Decorator</a></li>

<br>The Filter pattern is a special case of the Decorator pattern, where
a data source or data sink object is wrapped to add logic to the handling
of a data stream.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Composite"></a><b>Composite</b></li>

<br>The Composite pattern allows you to build complex objects by recursively
composing similar objects in a tree-like manner. The Composite pattern
also allows the objects in the tree to be manipulated in a consistent manner,
by requiring all of the objects in the tree to have a common superclass
or interface.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Chain of Responsibility">Chain of Responsibility</a></li>

<br>The Chain of Responsibility pattern can be combined with the Composite
pattern by adding child to parent links so that children can get information
from an ancestor without having to know which ancestor the information
came from.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
High Cohesion</li>

<br>The High Cohesion pattern (described in volume 2) discourages putting
specialized methods in general purpose classes, which is something that
the Composite pattern encourages.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Visitor">Visitor</a></li>

<br>You can use the Visitor pattern to encapsulate operations in a single
class that would otherwise be spread across multiple classes.</ul>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<a NAME="Structural Patterns"></a>Structural Patterns</h2>

<li>
<a NAME="Adapter"></a><b>Adapter</b></li>

<br>An Adapter class implements an interface known to its clients and provides
access to an instance of a class not know to its clients. An adapter object
provides the functionality promised by an interface without having to assume
what class is being used to implement that interface.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses2.htm#Anonymous Adapter">Anonymous Adapter</a></li>

<br>This is a coding pattern that uses anonymous adapter objects to handle
events.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Facade">Fa&ccedil;ade</a></li>

<br>The Adapter class provides an object that acts as an intermediary for
method calls between client objects and one other object not known to the
client objects. The Fa&ccedil;ade pattern provides an object that acts
as an intermediary for method calls between client objects and multiple
objects not know to the client objects.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Iterator">Iterator</a></li>

<br>The Iterator pattern is a specialized form of the Adapter pattern for
sequentially accessing the contents of collection objects.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Proxy">Proxy</a></li>

<br>The Proxy pattern, like the Adapter pattern, uses an object that is
a surrogate for another object. However, a Proxy object has the same interface
as the object for which it is a surrogate.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Strategy">Strategy</a></li>

<br>The Strategy pattern is structurally similar to the Adapter pattern.
The difference is in the intent. The Adapter pattern allows a Client object
to carry out its originally intended function in collaboration by calling
method of objects the implement a particular interface. The Strategy pattern
provides objects that implement a particular interface for the purpose
of altering or determining the behavior of a Client object.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Iterator"></a><b>Iterator</b></li>

<br>The Iterator pattern defines an interface that declares methods for
sequentially accessing the objects in a collection. A class that accesses
a collection only through such an interface remains independent of the
class that implements the interface.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Adapter">Adapter</a></li>

<br>The Iterator pattern is a specialized form of the Adapter pattern for
sequentially accessing the contents of collection objects.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Factory Method">Factory Method</a></li>

<br>Some collection classes may use the Factory Method pattern to determine
what kind of iterator to instantiate.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Null Object">Null Object</a></li>

<br>Null iterators are sometimes used to implement the Null Object pattern.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Bridge"></a><b>Bridge</b></li>

<br>The Bridge pattern is useful when there is a hierarchy of abstractions
and a corresponding hierarchy of implementations. Rather than combining
the abstractions and implementations into many distinct classes, the Bridge
pattern implements the abstractions and implementations as independent
classes that can be combined dynamically.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
Layered Architecture</li>

<br>The Bridge design pattern is a way of organizing the entities identified
using the Layered Architecture pattern (described in volume 2) into classes.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Abstract Factory">Abstract Factory</a></li>

<br>The Abstract Factory pattern can be used by the Bridge pattern to decide
which implementation class to instantiate for an abstraction object.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Facade"></a><b>Fa&ccedil;ade</b></li>

<br>The Fa&ccedil;ade pattern simplifies access to a related set of objects
by providing one object that all objects outside the set use to communicate
with the set.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Interface">Interface</a></li>

<br>The Interface pattern can be used with the Fa&ccedil;ade pattern to
allow different sets of fa&ccedil;ade and implementation classes to be
used without client classes having to be aware of the different classes.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses2.htm#Don't Talk to Strangers">Law of Demeter</a></li>

<br>A conceptual model that uses the Law of Demeter pattern often gives
rise to a design that follows the Fa&ccedil;ade pattern.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Flyweight"></a><b>Flyweight</b></li>

<br>If instances of a class that contain the same information can be used
interchangeably, the Flyweight pattern allows a program to avoid the expense
of multiple instances that contain the same information by sharing one
instance.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Composite">Composite</a></li>

<br>The Flyweight pattern is often combined with the Composite pattern
to represent the leaf nodes of a hierarchical structure with shared objects.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Factory Method">Factory Method</a></li>

<br>The Flyweight pattern uses the factory method pattern to create new
flyweight objects.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Immutable">Immutable</a></li>

<br>Shared flyweight objects are often immutable.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Dynamic Linkage"></a><b>Dynamic Linkage</b></li>

<br>Allow a program, upon request, to load and use arbitrary classes that
implement a known interface.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Virtual Proxy">Virtual Proxy</a></li>

<br>The Virtual Proxy sometimes uses the Dynamic Linkage pattern to load
the class that it needs to create its underlying object.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Virtual Proxy"></a><b>Virtual Proxy</b></li>

<br>If an object is expensive to instantiate and may not be needed, it
may be advantageous to postpone its instantiation until the object is needed.
The Virtual Proxy pattern hides the fact that an object may not yet exist
from its clients, by having them access the object indirectly through a
proxy object that implements the same interface as the object that may
not exist. The technique of delaying the instantiation of an object until
it is actually needed is sometimes called lazy instantiation.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Facade">Fa&ccedil;ade</a></li>

<br>The Fa&ccedil;ade pattern can be used with the Virtual Proxy pattern
to minimize the number of proxy classes that are needed.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Proxy">Proxy</a></li>

<br>The Virtual Proxy pattern is a specialized form of the Proxy pattern.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Decorator"></a><b>Decorator</b></li>

<br>The Decorator pattern extends the functionality of an object in a way
that is transparent to its clients. It does that by using an instance of
a subclass of the original class that delegates operations to the original
object.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;<a href="#Delegation">Delegation</a></li>

<br>The Decorator pattern is a structured way of applying the Delegation
pattern.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Filter">Filter</a></li>

<br>The Filter pattern is a specialized version of the Decorator pattern
that focuses on manipulating a data stream.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Strategy">Strategy</a></li>

<br>The Decorator pattern is useful for arranging for things to happen
before or after the methods of another object are called. If you want to
arrange for different things to happen in the middle of calls to a method,
consider using the Strategy pattern.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Template">Template Method</a></li>

<br>The Template Method pattern is an alternative to the Decorator pattern
that allows variable behavior in the middle of a method call instead of
before or after it.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Cache Management"></a><b>Cache Management</b></li>

<br>The Cache Management pattern allows fast access to objects that would
otherwise take a long time to access. It involves keeping a copy of objects
that are expensive to construct after the immediate need for the object
is over. The object may be expensive to construct for any number of reasons,
such as requiring a lengthy computation or being fetched from a database.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Facade">Fa&ccedil;ade</a></li>

<br>The Cache Management pattern uses the Fa&ccedil;ade pattern.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Publish-Subscribe</li>

<br>You can use the Publish-Subscribe pattern to ensure the read consistency
of a cache.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Remote Proxy</li>

<br>The Remote Proxy provides an alternative to the Cache Management pattern
by working with objects that exist in a remote environment rather than
fetching them into the local environment.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Template">Template Method</a></li>

<br>The Cache Management pattern uses the Template Method pattern to keep
its Cache class reusable across application domains.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Virtual Proxy">Virtual Proxy</a></li>

<br>The Cache Management pattern is often used with the Virtual Proxy pattern
to make the cache transparent to objects that access object in the cache.</ul>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<a NAME="Behavioral Patterns"></a>Behavioral Patterns</h2>

<li>
<a NAME="Chain of Responsibility"></a><b>Chain of Responsibility</b></li>

<br>The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows an object to send a command
without knowing what object or objects will receive it. It accomplishes
that by passing the command to a chain of objects that is typically part
of a larger structure. Each object in the chain may handle the command,
pass the command on to the next object in the chain or do both.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Composite">Composite</a></li>

<br>When the chain of objects used by the Chain of Responsibility pattern
is part of a larger structure, that larger structure is usually built using
the Composite pattern.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Command">Command</a></li>

<br>The Chain of Responsibility pattern makes the particular object that
executes a command indefinite. The Command pattern makes the object that
executes a command explicit and specific.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Template">Template Method</a></li>

<br>When the objects that make up a chain of responsibility are part of
a larger organization built using the Composite pattern, the Template Method
pattern is often used to organize the behavior of individual objects.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Command"></a><b>Command</b></li>

<br>Encapsulate commands in objects so that you can control their selection,
sequencing, queue them, undo them and otherwise manipulate them.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Factory Method">Factory Method</a></li>

<br>The Factory Method pattern is sometimes used to provide a layer of
indirection between a user interface and command classes.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Little Language / Interpreter">Little Language</a></li>

<br>You can use the Command Pattern to help implement the Little Language
pattern.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Snapshot">Snapshot</a></li>

<br>You can use the Snapshot pattern to provide a coarse grained undo mechanism
that saves the entire state of an object rather than a command by command
account of how to reconstruct previous states.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Template">Template Method</a></li>

<br>The Template Method pattern can be used to implement the top level
undo logic of the Command pattern.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Little Language / Interpreter"></a><b>Little Language / Interpreter</b></li>

<br>Suppose you need to solve many similar problems and you notice that
the solutions to these problems can be expressed as different combinations
of a small number of elements or operations. The simplest way to express
solutions to these problems may be to define a little language. Common
types of problems you can solve with little languages are searches of common
data structures, creation of complex data structures and formatting of
data.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Composite">Composite</a></li>

<br>A parse tree is organized with the Composite pattern.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Visitor">Visitor</a></li>

<br>The Visitor pattern allows you to encapsulate logic for simple manipulations
of a parse tree in a single class.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Mediator"></a><b>Mediator</b></li>

<br>The Mediator pattern uses an object to coordinate state changes between
other objects. Putting the logic in one object to manage state changes
of other objects, instead of distributing the logic over the other objects,
results in a more cohesive implementation of the logic and decreased coupling
between the other objects.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Adapter">Adapter</a></li>

<br>Mediator classes often use adapter objects to receive notifications
of state changes.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Interface">Interface</a></li>

<br>The Mediator pattern uses the Interface pattern to keep the Colleague
classes independent of the Mediator class.
<p><a href="pattern_synopses2.htm#Low Coupling/High Cohesion">Low Coupling/High
Cohesion</a>
<br>The Mediator pattern is an good example of an exception to the advice
of the Low Coupling/High Cohesion pattern.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Snapshot"></a><b>Snapshot</b></li>

<br>Capture a snapshot of an object's state so that the object's state
can be restored later. The object that initiates the capture or restoration
of the state does not need to know anything about the state information.
It only needs to know that the object whose state it is restoring or capturing
implements a particular interface.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Command">Command</a></li>

<br>The Command pattern allows state changes to be undone on a command
by command basis without having to make a snapshot of an object’s entire
state after every command.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Observer"></a><b>Observer</b></li>

<br>Allow objects to dynamically register dependencies between objects,
so that an object will notify those objects that are dependent on it when
its state changes.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Adapter">Adapter</a></li>

<br>The Adapter pattern can be used to allow objects that do not implement
the required interface to participate in the Observer pattern.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Delegation">Delegation</a></li>

<br>The Observer pattern uses the Delegation pattern.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Mediator">Mediator</a></li>

<br>The Mediator pattern is sometimes used to coordinate state changes
initiated by multiple objects to an Observable object.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="State"></a><b>State</b></li>

<br>Encapsulate the states of an object as discrete objects, each belonging
to a separate subclass of an abstract state class.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Flyweight">Flyweight</a></li>

<br>You can use the Flyweight pattern to share state objects.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Mediator">Mediator</a></li>

<br>The State pattern is often used with the Mediator pattern when implementing
user interfaces.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Singleton">Singleton</a></li>

<br>You can implement non-parametric states using the Singleton pattern.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Null Object"></a><b>Null Object</b></li>

<br>The Null Object pattern provides an alternative to using null to indicate
the absence of an object to delegate an operation to. Using null to indicate
the absence of such an object requires a test for null before each call
to the other object’s methods. Instead of using null, the Null Object pattern
uses a reference to an object that doesn’t do anything.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Singleton">Singleton</a></li>

<br>If instances of a class whose methods do nothing contain no instance
specific information, then you can save time and memory by implementing
it as a singleton class.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Strategy">Strategy</a></li>

<br>The Null Object pattern is often used with the Strategy pattern.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Strategy"></a><b>Strategy</b></li>

<br>Encapsulate related algorithms in classes that are subclasses of a
common superclass. This allows the selection of algorithm to vary by object
and also allows it to vary over time.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Adapter">Adapter</a></li>

<br>The Adapter pattern is structurally similar to the Strategy pattern.
The difference is in the intent. The Adapter pattern allows a client object
to carry out its originally intended function by calling methods of objects
that implement a particular interface. The Strategy pattern provides objects
that implement a particular interface for the purpose of altering or determining
the behavior of a client object.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Flyweight">Flyweight</a></li>

<br>If there are many client objects, they may share strategy objects if
they are implemented as Flyweights.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Null Object">Null Object</a></li>

<br>The Strategy pattern is often used with the Null Object pattern.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Template">Template Method</a></li>

<br>The Template method pattern manages alternate behaviors through subclassing
rather than delegation.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Template"></a><b>Template Method</b></li>

<br>Write an abstract class that contains only part of the logic needed
to accomplish its purpose. Organize the class so that its concrete methods
call an abstract method where the missing logic would have appeared. Provide
the missing logic in subclass’ methods that override the abstract methods.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Strategy">Strategy</a></li>

<br>The Strategy pattern modifies the logic of individual objects. The
Template Method pattern modifies the logic of an entire class.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Visitor"></a><b>Visitor</b></li>

<br>One way to implement an operation that involves objects in a complex
structure is to provide logic in each of their classes to support the operation.
The Visitor pattern provides an alternative way to implement such operations
that avoids complicating the classes of the objects in the structure by
putting all of the necessary logic in a separate visitor class. The Visitor
pattern also allows the logic to be varied by using different visitor classes.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
Iterator</li>

<br>The Iterator pattern is an alternative to the Visitor pattern when
the object structure to be navigated has a linear structure.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Little Language / Interpreter">Little Language</a></li>

<br>In the Little Language pattern, you can use the Visitor Pattern to
implement the interpreter part of the pattern.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Composite">Composite</a></li>

<br>The Visitor pattern is often used with object structures that are organized
according to the Composite pattern.</ul>

<h2>
<a NAME="Concurrency Patterns"></a>Concurrency Patterns</h2>
&nbsp;
<li>
<a NAME="Single Threaded Execution"></a><b>Single Threaded Execution</b></li>

<br>&nbsp;Some methods access data or other shared resources in a way that
produces incorrect results if there are concurrent calls to a method and
both calls access the data or other resource at the same time. The Single
Threaded Execution pattern solves this problem by preventing concurrent
calls to the method from resulting in concurrent executions of the method.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a NAME="Guarded Suspension"></a><b>Guarded Suspension</b></li>

<br>&nbsp;Suspend execution of a method call until a precondition is satisfied.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Balking">Balking</a></li>

<br>The Balking pattern provides a different strategy for handling method
calls to objects that are not in an appropriate state to execute the method
call.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Two-Phase">Two-Phase Termination</a></li>

<br>Because the implementation of the Two-Phase Termination pattern usually
involves the throwing and handling of <tt>InterruptedException</tt>, its
implementation usually interacts with the Guarded Suspension pattern.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Balking"></a><b>Balking</b></li>

<br>&nbsp;If an object’s method is called when the object is not in an
appropriate state to execute that method, have the method return without
doing anything.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses2.htm#Double Checked Locking">Double Checked Locking</a></li>

<br>The Double Checked Locking coding pattern (described in volume 2) is
structurally simillar to the Balking pattern. Its intention is different.
The balking pattern avoids executing code when an object is in the wrong
state. The Double Checked Locking pattern avoids executing code to avoid
unnecessary work.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Guarded Suspension">Guarded Suspension</a></li>

<br>The Guarded Suspension pattern provides an alternate way to handle
method calls to objects that are not in an appropriate state to execute
the method call.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Single Threaded Execution">Single Threaded Execution</a></li>

<br>The Balking pattern is often combined with the Single Threaded Execution
pattern to coordinate changes to an object’s state.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Scheduler"></a><b>Scheduler</b></li>

<br>&nbsp;Control the order in which threads are scheduled to execute single
threaded code using an object that explicitly sequences waiting threads.
The Scheduler pattern provides a mechanism for implementing a scheduling
policy. It is independent of any specific scheduling policy.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Read/Write Lock">Read/Write Lock</a></li>

<br>Implementations of the Read/Write Lock pattern usually use the Scheduler
pattern to ensure fairness in scheduling.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Read/Write Lock"></a><b>Read/Write Lock</b></li>

<br>&nbsp;Allow concurrent read access to an object but require exclusive
access for write operations.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Single Threaded Execution">Single Threaded Execution</a></li>

<br>The Single Threaded Execution pattern is a good and simpler alternative
to the Read/Write Lock pattern when most of the accesses to data are write
accesses.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Scheduler">Scheduler</a></li>

<br>The Read/Write Lock pattern is a specialized form of the Scheduler
pattern.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Producer-Consumer"></a><b>Producer-Consumer</b></li>

<br>&nbsp;Coordinate the asynchronous production and consumption of information
or objects.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Guarded Suspension">Guarded Suspension</a></li>

<br>The Producer-Consumer pattern uses the Guarded Suspension pattern to
manage the situation of a Consumer object wanting to get an object from
an empty queue.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Pipe</li>

<br>The Pipe pattern is a special case of the Producer-Consumer pattern
that involves only one Producer object an only one Consumer object. The
Pipe pattern usually refers to the Producer object as a data source and
the Consumer object as a data sink.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Scheduler">Scheduler</a></li>

<br>The Producer-Consumer pattern can be viewed as a special form of the
Scheduler pattern that has scheduling policy with two notable features.
<ul>
<li>
The scheduling policy is based on the availability of a resource.</li>

<li>
The scheduler assigns the resource to a thread but does not need to regain
control of the resource when the thread is done so it can reassign the
resource to another thread.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Two-Phase"></a><b>Two-Phase Termination</b></li>

<br>Provide for the orderly shutdown of a thread or process through the
setting of a latch. The thread or process checks the value of the latch
at strategic points in its execution.

<h2>
<a NAME="GRASP Patterns"></a>GRASP Patterns</h2>
GRASP is an acronym for General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns.
GRASP Patterns provide guidance for assigning responsibilities to classes
and, to a limited extent, determining the classes that will be in a design.
<p>This book discusses GRASP patterns as they are applied to object oriented
design. Most GRASP patterns apply equally well to business process reengineering.
<p>During analysis, when you are building a conceptual model of an organization
that has more than one way to do something, GRASP patterns can provide
guidance in selecting paths through the organization to include in the
conceptual model.
<ul>
<li>
<a NAME="Low Coupling/High Cohesion"></a><b>Low Coupling/High Cohesion</b></li>

<br>If you find that a class is so highly coupled or lacking in cohesion
as to make a design brittle or difficult to modify, then apply other appropriate
GRASP patterns to reassign the class’ responsibilities.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Interface">Interface</a></li>

<br>One form of coupling between classes is the coupling between a subclass
and its superclass. It is often possible to avoid subclassing by using
the Interface pattern.</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Mediator">Mediator</a></li>

<br>It is not necessary or even always desirable for all of the classes
in a design to have low coupling and high cohesion. Sometimes the overall
complexity of a class can be reduced by concentrating complexity in one
class. The Mediator pattern provides an example of that.</ul>

<ul>&nbsp;</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Composed Method">Composed Method</a></li>

<br>It is possible for methods to be uncohesive and difficult to work with.
Some common causes are excessive length or too many execution paths within
a method. The Composed Method pattern provides guidance of breaking up
such methods into smaller, simpler and more cohesive methods.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Expert"></a><b>Expert</b></li>

<br>Assign a responsibility to the class that has the information needed
to carry out the responsibility.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Low Coupling/High Cohesion">Low Coupling/High Cohesion</a></li>

<br>The Expert pattern promotes low coupling by putting methods in the
classes that have the information that the methods need. Classes whose
methods only need the class’ own information have less need to rely on
other classes. A set of methods that all operate on the same information
tends to be cohesive.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Creator"></a><b>Creator</b></li>

<br>Determine which class should create instances of a class based on the
relationship between the potential creator classes and the class to be
instantiated.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a NAME="Polymorphism"></a><b>Polymorphism</b></li>

<br>When alternate behaviors are selected based on the type of an object,
use a polymorphic method call to select the behavior, rather than using
if statements to test the type.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Dynamic Linkage">Dynamic Linkage</a></li>

<br>You can implement plug-ins or pluggable software components using a
combination of polymorphism and the Dynamic Linkage pattern.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Pure Fabrication"></a><b>Pure Fabrication</b></li>

<br>Fabricate a class that does not represent a problem domain entity when
you must assign a responsibility to a class, but assigning it to a class
that represents a problem domain entity would ruin its low coupling or
high cohesion.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Low Coupling/High Cohesion">Low Coupling/High Cohesion</a></li>

<br>The point of the Pure Fabrication pattern is to maintain the low coupling
and high cohesion of the classes in an object oriented design.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Don't Talk to Strangers"></a><b>Law of Demeter</b></li>

<br>If two classes have no other reason to be directly aware of each other
or otherwise coupled, then the two classes should not directly interact.
Instead of having a class call the methods of another class that it has
no other reason to be coupled with, it should call that method indirectly
through another class. Insisting on such indirection keeps a design’s overall
level of coupling down.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Low Coupling/High Cohesion">Low Coupling/High Cohesion</a></li>

<br>The fundamental motivation for the Don’t Talk to Strangers pattern
is to maintain low coupling.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Pure Fabrication">Pure Fabrication</a></li>

<br>There are sometimes good reasons for calls made to classes added to
a design using the Pure Fabrication pattern to violate the guidelines of
the Don’t Talk to Strangers pattern.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Mediator">Mediator</a></li>

<br>The Mediator pattern provides an example of a class created through
pure fabrication that receives direct method calls from classes unrelated
to it with a benefit that outweighs the disadvantages of the direct calls.</ul>
<a NAME="Controller"></a><b>Controller</b>
<br>&nbsp;If a program will receive events from external sources other
than its graphical user interface, add an event class to decouple the event
source(s) from the objects that actually handle the events.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Pure Fabrication">Pure Fabrication</a></li>

<br>The Controller pattern is a specialized form of the Pure Fabrication
pattern.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Mediator">Mediator</a></li>

<br>The Mediator pattern is used to coordinates events from a GUI.&nbsp;
Like controller objects, a highly coupled and incohesive&nbsp; mediator
object may involve less overall complexity than an arrangement that distributes
the same responsibilities over more objects.</ul>
</ul>

<h2>
<a NAME="GUI Design Patterns"></a>GUI Design Patterns</h2>

<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;<a NAME="Window Per Task"></a><b>Window Per Task</b></li>

<br>&nbsp;A GUI should have a separate window for each cohesive task a
user must perform. All information needed to perform the task is available
from the window. The application provides a way to navigate between windows
that allows the coordination of tasks.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Low Coupling/High Cohesion">Low Coupling/High Cohesion</a></li>

<br>The Task per Window pattern is based on the principles of low coupling
and high cohesion.</ul>

<li>
&nbsp;<a NAME="Interaction Style"></a><b>Interaction Style</b></li>

<br>&nbsp;Match the style of interaction offered by a GUI to the abilities
of its users and the requirements of the application. The most common styles

of interaction modes.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Explorable Interface"></a><b>Explorable Interface</b></li>

<br>Design user interaction to be forgiving of the user’s mistakes by allowing
the user to undo actions and go back to previous decision points.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Command">Command</a></li>

<br>The Command pattern describes a way to undo the effects of a command
or the performance of a task.
<br>&nbsp;

<h2>
<a NAME="Organizational Coding Patterns"></a>Organizational Coding Patterns</h2>

<ul>The patterns in this chapter provide guidance in organizing your code
in ways that promote readability and maintainability. A principle that
underlies many of these patterns is that simple code is easier to understand
and less likely to contain bugs.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a NAME="Accessor Method"></a><b>Accessor Method Name</b></li>

<br>Use names and signatures for accessor methods that are easy to read
and conform to the JavaBeans specification.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a NAME="Anonymous Adapter"></a><b>Anonymous Adapter</b></li>

<br>Use anonymous adapter objects to handle events. This simplifies the
code and allows code relating to the same event source to be in the same
part of the source code.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm">Adapter</a></li>

<br>The Anonymous Adapters pattern uses Adapter objects.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Mediator">Mediator</a></li>

<br>&nbsp;If handling events from multiple sources involves managing or
using common or interrelated state information, then the Mediator pattern
may provide a better way to handle the events.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Hashed Adapter Objects">Hashed Adapter Objects</a></li>

<br>You can use the hashed Adapter Objects pattern to provide a more flexible
way to manage event handlers than the Anonymous Adapters pattern.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Symbolic Name"></a><b>Symbolic Constant Name</b></li>

<br>&nbsp;Use symbolic names for constants. A meaningful name makes the
purpose of the constant clear to someone reading the code. Symbolic names
can also simplify maintenance.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Immutable">Immutable</a></li>

<br>The Immutable pattern describes other uses for immutable objects.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Switch">Switch</a></li>

<br>Code that uses the Switch pattern should also use the Symbolic Constant
Name pattern.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Define Constants in Interfaces"></a><b>Define Constants in Interfaces</b></li>

<br>Avoid having to qualify symbolic constant names with the name of the
class that defines them. Define them in an interface. That way, any class
that implements the interface can use the symbolic names without any qualification.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Symbolic Name">Symbolic Constant Name</a></li>

<br>This pattern only applies to classes that use symbolic names for constants.</ul>

on an <tt>int</tt> data value by using a switch statement.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Hashed Adapter Objects">Hashed Adapter Objects</a></li>

<br>Switch statements associate <tt>int</tt> values pieces of code. The
Hashed Adapter Objects pattern associates objects with pieces of code.</ul>

<br>Code that uses the Switch pattern should also use the Symbolic Constant
Name pattern.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Polymorphism">Polymorphism</a></li>

<br>In many situations, polymorphic method calls are a more appropriate
technique than switch statements. However, people with a background in

use switch statements when polymorphic method calls would be more appropriate.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Extend Super"></a><b>Extend Super</b></li>

<br>Implement a method that modifies the behavior of a superclass’ method
by calling the superclass’ method.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Composed Method">Composed Method</a></li>

<br>The Composed Method pattern describes the more general case of composing
the behavior of a method from the behavior of other methods.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Template">Template Method</a></li>

<br>The Template Method pattern describes a way to design a class that
plans for its behavior to be extended by a subclass’s methods. It provides
more flixibility and control over how a subclass extends the behavior of
its superclass than the Extend Super pattern at the expense of greater
complexity. In particular, the Template Method patterns allows behavior
of a subclass to occur in the middle of the exection of superclass’s methods.
The template method pattern can also be used to force a subclass to extend
a superclass in predefined ways.</ul>

<br>As part of its contract with its callers, a method may be expected
to throw exceptions under certain circumstances. Those exceptions should
be checked exceptions. Any exceptions a method throws that are outside
of its contract, such exceptions to indicate internal errors or to help
with debugging, should be unchecked exceptions.

<br>Many programs are organized into layers related to different domains,
such as database management and an application domain. In such programs,

<h2>
<a NAME="Code Optimization Patterns"></a>Code Optimization Patterns</h2>

<ul>The patterns in this chapter can be used to improve the performance
of a program in ways that a compiler’s automatic optimizations cannot accomplish.
Like any other kind of optimization, you should use the patterns in this
chapter only after you have established a definite need for them. For example,
the Loop Unrolling pattern reduces the amount of time required to execute
a loop. It does so at the expense of making the code larger and harder
to understand and maintain. If the program makes enough loop iterations
for a small reduction in the duration of each iteration to produce a noticeable
improvement, that is a good application of the Loop Unrolling pattern.
If applying the Loop Unrolling pattern does not produce a noticeable improvement,
then you have made you program more difficult to understand an maintain
with no corresponding benefit.
<p>The usual way to determine what to optimize is to run a program using
a good execution profiling tool. Such tools are able to tell you how much
time a program spends in different methods or statements. They are also
able to indicate the percentage of time that the program spent in each
place and the number of times that each statement or method was executed.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a NAME="Hashed Adapter Objects"></a><b>Hashed Adapter Objects</b></li>

<br>Dispatch a method call to an adapter object associated with an arbitrary
object. The arbitrary object is used to find the adapter object in a hash
table. The Hashed Adapter Objects pattern is most commonly used when an
object must be created from unencapsulated data or unencapsulated data
must be dispatched to an object.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Adapter">Adapter</a></li>

<br>The Hashed Adapter Objects pattern uses Adapter objects.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Lookup Table">Lookup Table</a></li>

<br>Both the Hashed Adapter Objects pattern and the Lookup Table pattern
involve the use of an aggregation. However, the aggegation serves a different
purpose for each. The Lookup Table pattern uses an aggregation of precomputed
results to save the time it would take to compute those results in the
future. For the Hashed Adapter Objects pattern, it is that data structure
that implements the aggregation that is the source of the time savings.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Polymorphism">Polymorphism</a></li>

<br>When it is possible to select a behavior based on the type of an object,
the Polymorphism pattern produces a simpler result than the Hashed Adapter
Objects pattern.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Single Threaded Execution">Single Threaded
Execution</a></li>

initialize a variable until it is known that the variable will be used.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Maximize Privacy">Maximize Privacy</a></li>

<br>The Maximize Privacy pattern provides a justification for making a
lazily initialized variable private.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Virtual Proxy">Virtual Proxy</a></li>

<br>Like the Lazy Initialization pattern, the Virtual Proxy pattern can
be used to delay a computation or the creation of an object until it is
actually needed. The difference is that the Virtual Proxy pattern uses
a proxy object to hide the computation; the Lazy Initialization pattern
uses a method to hide the computation.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Double Checked Locking"></a><b>Double Checked Locking</b></li>

<br>&nbsp;A multi-threaded program does not initialize a resource until
it actually needs the resource. One thread recognizes that that resource
is not yet initialized when another thread has already begun the initialization.
Avoid duplicating the initialization effort by coordinating the actions
of multiple threads.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Balking">Balking</a></li>

<br>The Balking design pattern is usually implemented using the same if-synchronized-if
structure as the Double Checked Locking pattern.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>

<br>&nbsp;The Double Checked Locking pattern can be used in a thread safe
implementation of the Virtual Proxy pattern.</ul>

<li>
&nbsp;<a NAME="Loop Unrolling"></a><b>Loop Unrolling</b></li>

<br>Reduce the overhead of a loop’s control logic by increasing the amount
of work it does in each iteration so that it can accomplish the same amount
of work in fewer iterations. This pattern trades memory for speed.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a NAME="Lookup Table"></a><b>Lookup Table</b></li>

<br>Save the memory consumed by complex code and the time it takes to execute
by precomputing the results and putting them in a lookup table.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Hashed Adapter Objects">Hashed Adapter Objects</a></li>

<br>Both the Hashed Adapter Objects pattern and the Lookup Table pattern
involve the use of an aggregation. However, the aggegation serves a different

<a NAME="Return New Objects from Accessor Method"></a><b>Return New Objects
from Accessor Method</b></li>

<br>Accessor methods return values or objects that indicate an object’s
state. If the objects that an accessor method returns are mutable, then
they should be copies rather than the actual state determining objects.
That prevents changes to the returned object from also changing the state
of the accessor method’s associated object.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Copy Mutable Parameters">Copy Mutable Parameters</a></li>

<br>The Return New Objects from Accessor Method pattern avoids the situation
of an object sharing its state determining objects with callers of its
accessor methods. The Copy Mutable Parameters pattern avoids a similar
situation with callers that pass state determining objects into its constructors
and methods.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Copy Mutable Parameters"></a><b>Copy Mutable Parameters</b></li>

<br>Objects may be passed to a method or constructor that will be used
to determine the state of its associated object. If the passed objects
are mutable, then copies of them should be used to determine the object’s
state, rather than the original passed object. That prevents changes to
the passed object from also changing the state of the object associated
with the method or constructor.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Return New Objects from Accessor Method">Return New Objects from

<h2>
<a NAME="Transaction Patterns"></a>Transaction Patterns</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<a NAME="ACID Transaction"></a><b>ACID Transaction</b></li>

<br>Ensure that a transaction will never have any unexpected or inconsistent
outcome. You do that by ensuring that the transaction has the ACID properties:
atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Snapshot">Snapshot</a></li>

<br>The Snapshot pattern describes techniques for saving and restoring
the state of objects. This is the better way to recover from a transaction
failure when a transaction involves a long sequence of operations that
modify the state of a small number of simple objects.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Command">Command</a></li>

<br>The command pattern describes techniques for remembering and undoing
a sequence of operations. This is the better way to recover from a transaction
failure when a transaction involves a short sequence of operations that
modify the state of a large number of complex objects.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Audit Trail">Audit Trail</a></li>

<br>Logging a sequence of operations to support the Command Pattern is
structurally similar to maintaining an audit trail.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses2.htm#System Testing">System Testing</a></li>

<br>The System Testing pattern should be used to ensure the consistency
of transactions.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses2.htm#Unit Testing">Unit Testing</a></li>

<br>The Unit Testing pattern may also help to ensure the consistency of
transactions.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Single Threaded Execution">Single Threaded
Execution</a></li>

<br>The Single Threaded Execution Pattern can be used to keep transactions
that modify the state of the same object isolated from each other, so that
the modifications each transaction makes to the object’s state do not interfere
with each other.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Read/Write Lock">Read/Write Lock</a></li>

<br>The Read/Write Lock pattern can be used to keep transactions that use
the same object isolated from each other while allowing transactions that
do not modify the object’s state to execute concurrently.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Proxy">Copy on Write Proxy</a></li>

<br>The Copy on Write Proxy pattern can be used to help ensured the isolation
property of transactions. The Copy on Write Proxy is described as part
of the write-up of the Proxy pattern in Volume 1.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses2.htm#Copy Mutable Parameters">Copy Mutable Parameters</a></li>

<br>The Copy Mutable Parameters pattern can be used to help ensure the
isoplation property of transactions.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses2.htm#Return New Objects from Accessor Method">Return
New Objects from Accessor Method</a></li>

<br>The Return New Objects from Accessor Method pattern (described in Volume
2) can be used to help ensure the isolation property of transactions.
<p>Return Mutable Objects from Accessor Method
<br>The Return Mutable Objects from Accessor Method (described in Volume
2) can be used to help ensure the isolation property of transactions.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Cache Consistency">Cache Consistency</a></li>

<br>If you directly manage the storage of persistent distributed objects,
you may need the Cache Consistency pattern to ensure that the result of
a locally initiated read operation matches the current contents of a remote
store.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Decorator">Decorator</a></li>

<br>If an object that does not support access controls such as single threaded
execution or read/write lock must participate in an ACID transaction, the
object’s deficiency can be compensated for by making the TransactionManager
access the object through a decorator object.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Composite Transaction"></a><b>Composite Transaction</b></li>

<br>You want to design and implement transactions correctly and with a
minimum of effort. Simple transactions are easier to implement and make
correct than complex transactions. Design and implement complex transactions
from simpler ACID transactions.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#ACID Transaction">ACID Transaction</a></li>

<br>The Composite Transaction pattern is built on the ACID transaction
pattern.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Command">Command</a></li>

<br>The Command Pattern can be the basis for an undo mechanism used to
undo operations and restore object to the state they were in at the beginning
of a transaction.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses2.htm#Composed Method">Composed Method</a></li>

<br>&nbsp;The Composed Method pattern is a coding pattern that describes
a way of composing methods from other methods that is structurally similar
to the way the Composite Transaction pattern composes transactions.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Lock File">Lock File</a></li>

<br>&nbsp;The Lock File pattern can be used to enforce the isolation property
for a composite transaction.</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Two Phase Commit">Two Phase Commit</a></li>

<br>The Two Phase Commit pattern can be used to ensure the ACID properties
of a composite transaction composed from simpler ACID transactions.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Mailbox">Mailbox</a></li>

<br>When there is a need to ensure the reliability a composite transaction,
you will want to take steps to ensure the reliability of the component
transactions that constitute it. If the composite transaction is distributed,
you will also want to ensure the reliable transmission of messages between
the objects that participate in the transaction by such means as the Mailbox
pattern.</ul>

<li>
&nbsp;<a NAME="Two Phase Commit"></a><b>Two Phase Commit</b></li>

<br>If a transaction is composed of simpler transactions distributed across
multiple database managers, you want them to either all complete successfully
or to all abort, leaving all objects as they were before the transactions.
You achieve this by making an object responsible for coordinating the transactions
so that they all complete successfully or all abort.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#ACID Transaction">ACID Transaction</a></li>

<br>The Two Phase Commit pattern is used to build composite transactions
having the ACID properties from component transactions that have the ACID
properties.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Composite Transaction">Composite Transaction</a></li>

<br>The Two Phase Commit pattern is used with the Composite Transaction
pattern
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Decorator">Decorator</a></li>

<br>The Decorator pattern provides the basis for the organization of the
wrapper objects used in the Two Phase Commit pattern.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Heartbeat">Heartbeat</a></li>

<br>The Heartbeat pattern may be used with the Two Phase Commit pattern
to ensure that the Coordinator object is able to detect catastrophic failures
of component transactions in a bounded amount of time.</ul>
<a NAME="Audit Trail"></a><b>Audit Trail</b>
<br>You need to verify that transactions are being processed correctly
and honestly. Maintain an historical record of transactions that have been
applied to an object or set of objects. The record should contain enough
detail to determine how the objects affected by the transactions reached
their current state.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#ACID Transaction">ACID Transaction</a></li>

<br>If the transactions in an historical record do not have the ACID properties,
then it may not be possible to unambiguously determine the effect of each
transaction on an object.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Snapshot">Snapshot</a></li>

<br>The Snapshot pattern provides advice on how to capture the state of
an object.</ul>
</ul>

<h2>
<a NAME="Distributed Architecture Patterns"></a>Distributed Architecture
Patterns</h2>

<ul><a NAME="Shared Object"></a><b>Shared Object</b>
<br>You have some information or a limited quantity of a resource. You
share objects among multiple clients to share encapsulated information
or underlying resources. You centrally manage the object sharing with a
separate object, so the sharing does not add to the complexity of the objects
being shared or the objects sharing them.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Static Locking Order">Static Locking Order</a></li>

<br>If Client objects work with multiple <tt>Manager</tt> objects to concurrently
access multiple types of <tt>Resource</tt> objects, it is possible for
two client objects to deadlock while waiting for different resources. Client
objects should use the Static Locking Order pattern to avoid this sort
of deadlock.</ul>

<ul TYPE=CIRCLE>
<li>
<a href="#Object Replication">Object Replication</a></li>

<br>The Object Replication pattern provides a decentralized way for the
clients of an object to share information.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Broker">Object Request Broker</a></li>

<br>The Object Request Broker pattern can be used to allow objects to be
shared by remote clients.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Scheduler">Scheduler</a></li>

<br>The Scheduler pattern describes a way to schedule access, one client
at a time, to shared resources.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Read/Write Lock">Read/Write Lock</a></li>

<br>The Read/Write lock pattern is a specialized form of the Scheduler
pattern. It allows multiple clients to concurrently have read access to
a resource, but only allows exclusive access for a client that modifies
the resource.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Singleton">Singleton</a></li>

<br>The Singleton pattern describes classes that have a single instance
that may or may not be shared. The Shared Object pattern describes objects
that are shared and may have multiple instances.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Flyweight">Flyweight</a></li>

<br>If an object has no intrinsic state, then there is generally no need
to impose concurrency restrictions on access to the object. The Shared
Object pattern is inappropriate for sharing such objects, because it adds
unnecessary overhead. The Flyweight pattern (found in Volume 1) describes
a way that objects with no intrinsic state can be shared by local clients
any concurrency restrictions.</ul>
<a NAME="Broker"></a><b>Object Request Broker</b>
<br>&nbsp;Objects in a distributed environment need to call methods of
remote objects. For remote calls to work, many details must be just right.
Provide an infrastructure that allows objects to make remote calls, with
most of the details of the call hidden and handled automatically by the
infrastructure.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul TYPE=CIRCLE>
<li>
<a href="#Object Identifier">Object Identifier</a></li>

<br>The Object Identifier pattern provides additional guidance on uniquely
identifying possibly remote objects.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Heartbeat">Heartbeat Pattern</a></li>

<br>The Heartbeat pattern provides a general purpose way to detect when
the caller of a remote method will never see the call complete because
the machine that the remote call runs on has crashed or the network connection
to the remote machine has been lost.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Registry">Registry</a></li>

<br>The Registry pattern describes a way for an Object Request Broker implementation
to find remote objects that have a know name or unique object identifier.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Thread Pool">Thread Pool</a></li>

<br>CallDispatcher objects need a thread to process each remote call. An
implementation of the Object Request Broker pattern can use the Thread
Pool pattern to recycle threads and avoid the expense of creating new threads.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Object Replication"></a><b>Object Replication</b></li>

<br>You need to improve the throughput or availability of a distributed
computation. A distributed computation is a computation that involves objects
that reside on multiple computing elements and are able to communicate
with each other. In some circumstances, it is possible to improve the availability
and throughput of a computation by replicating an object onto multiple
computing elements while maintaining the illusion to the object’s clients
of there only being a single object.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul TYPE=CIRCLE>
<li>
<a href="#High Availability">High Availability</a></li>

<br>The High Availability pattern is a more specialized pattern that describes
the use of replication to make objects highly available.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Optimistic Concurrency">Optimistic Concurrency</a></li>

<br>The Optimistic Concurrency pattern describes how to update data without
the use of locks.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Immutable">Immutable</a></li>

<br>The Immutable pattern explains the simplicity and safety that comes
from designing objects to be immutable.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Broker">Object Request Broker</a></li>

<br>The Object Request Broker pattern allows an object to be used in multiple
places at the same time without it being in multiple places or replicated.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Redundant Independant Objects"></a><b>Redundant Independant Objects</b></li>

<br>You need to ensure the availability of an object even if it or the
platform it is running on experience a failure. You accomplish this by
providing redundant objects that do not rely on any single common resource.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#High Availability">Prompt Repair</a></li>

<br>The Prompt Repair pattern is often used with the Redundant Independent
Objects pattern to ensure the continued availability of a set of redundant
independent objects even after a failure occurs.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Object Replication">Object Replication</a></li>

<br>The Redundant Independent Objects pattern is a specialized version
of the Object Replication pattern.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="High Availability"></a><b>Prompt Repair</b></li>

<br>When one of a set of redundant independent objects fails, one fewer
failures must occur before the entire set of redundant objects becomes
unavailable. To minimize the likelihood of a catastrophic failure, repair
the failed object as soon as possible.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Redundant Independant Objects">Redundant Independent Objects</a></li>

<br>The Prompt Repair pattern is use with the Redundant Independent Object
pattern.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Process Pair">Process Pair</a></li>

<br>The Process Pair pattern is used to ensure that software components
on the same computing element are restarted when they fail.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Snapshot">Snapshot</a></li>

<br>The Snapshot pattern (described in Volume 1) can be used to implement
checkpoint/restart.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Mobile Agent"></a><b>Mobile Agent</b></li>

<br>An object needs to access very large volume of remote data. To conserve
network bandwidth, Instead instead of bringing data to an object, move
the object to the data.
<p>Related patterns are:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Broker">Object Request Broker</a></li>

<br>The Object Request Broker pattern is usually used with the Mobile Agent
pattern to facilitate communications between mobile agents and other objects.
Mobile agents can be implemented on top of the Object Request Broker pattern.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Object Replication">Object Replication</a></li>

<br>One of the applications of the Object Replication pattern is to ensure
that an object is near its accessors. The Mobile Agent pattern provides
a way for an object’s accessors to be near the object.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Demilitarized Zone"></a><b>Demilitarized Zone</b></li>

<br>You don’t want hackers to be able to gain access to servers containing
sensitive information if they are able to compromise the security of a
publicly accessible server. Put servers that are accessible to the public
Internet on a publicly accessible LAN that connects with bothbetween your
private networkfirewall and the public Internet.
<p>Related pattern are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Protection Proxy">Protection Proxy</a></li>

similar to the Demilitarized Zone pattern at the network level.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Process Pair"></a><b>Process Pair</b></li>

a unique identity when it is shared between programs or databases.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Broker">Objecct Request Broker</a> and <a href="#Registry">Registry</a></li>

<li>
<a NAME="Registry"></a><b>Registry</b></li>

<br>Objects need to contact another object, knowing only the object’s name
or the name of the service it provides, but not its how to contact it.
Provide a service that takes the name of an object, service or role and
returns a remote proxy that encapsulates the knowledge of how to contact
the named object.

<li>
<a NAME="Protection Proxy"></a><b>Protection Proxy</b></li>

<br>Malicious objects may attempt to violate the integrity of other objects
by using reflection or other means to access methods or variables they
should not. You can prevent this by requiring other objects to access sensitive
objects through a proxy that limits access based on security considerations.
The proxy implements measures to ensure that other objects do not gain
access to features of a sensitive object that they are not entitled to.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Proxy">Proxy</a></li>

<br>The Protection Proxy pattern is a specialized version of the Proxy

<br>You are designing an application client that should be as small and
thin as possible. The client must access some objects that have many attributes
and/or attributes that are large objects. The client does not always need
the attributes, so you arrange for the client to download the objects without
the attributes and then lazily download the attributes on an as needed
basis.

the Connection Multiplexing pattern can determine how you choose to implement
the Heartbeat pattern.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Connection Multiplexing"></a><b>Connection Multiplexing</b></li>

<br>You are designing a distributed system in which one object may establish
many connections with another object. To avoid the overhead of setting
up and shutting down many connections between the same two objects, you
arrange for one actual connection to carry the contents of multiple virtual
connections.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>

<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Scheduler">Scheduler</a></li>

<br>The Scheduler pattern can be used to ensure that all virtual connections
get their fair share of the actual connection’s bandwidth. The Scheduling
pattern describes how to enforce a policy that determines when a thread
is scheduled to use a resource.</ul>

<h2>
&nbsp;<a NAME="Distributed Concurrency Patterns"></a>Concurrency Patterns</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<a NAME="Session Object"></a><b>Session Object</b></li>

<br>A server’s sessions with clients have state information associated
with them, but you don’t want to duplicate a lot of objects for each session.
Use a single object to contain all the state information needed during
a session by the server and make that object accessible to all other objects
that need state information for the current session.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Singleton">Singleton</a></li>

<br>The Singleton pattern (described in Volume 1) uses a single instance
of a class for an entire program. The Session pattern uses a single instance
of a class per session.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="#Thread Pool">Thread Pool</a></li>

<br>You can use the Thread Pool pattern to manage the association between
threads and sessions over time.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Lock File"></a><b>Lock File</b></li>

<br>A program will need to have exclusive access to an external resource.
You design the program to check for the existence of a lock file prior
to accessing the resource. If the lock file exists, the program does not
use the resource. If the lock file does not exist, the program creates
the file and then uses the resource.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Static Locking Order">Static Locking Order</a></li>

<br>The Static Locking Order pattern is used with the Lock File pattern
when there are multiple resources to be coordinated, in order to avoid
deadlocks.

<a href="#ACID Transaction">ACID Transaction</a></li>

<br>The lock file pattern may be used in the implementation of the ACID
Transaction pattern.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Static Locking Order"></a><b>Static Locking Order</b></li>

<br>If two objects need exclusive access to the same set of resources,
they can become deadlocked with each holding a lock on one resource and
waiting for the other to release its resource. You can avoid such deadlocks
by ensuring that all objects acquire locks on resources in the same order.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#ACID Transaction">ACID Transaction</a></li>

<br>The Static Locking Order pattern can be used in the design of ACID

<li>
<a NAME="Optimistic Concurrency"></a><b>Optimistic Concurrency</b></li>

<br>Improve throughput of transaction processing by not waiting for locks
that a transaction will need. Instead, be optimistic and perform the transaction
logic on private copies of the records or objects involved. Do insist that
the locks be granted before the updates can be committed, but abort the
transaction if conflicting updates were made prior to the granting of the
locks.
<p>Related patterns are

<li>
<a NAME="Thread Pool"></a><b>Thread Pool</b></li>

<br>The nature of many servers is that they are presented with a steady
stream of tasks to perform that must each be performed in their own thread.
Creating a thread is a relatively expensive operation. Avoid the expense
of creating a thread for each task by reusing threads.
<p>Related patterns are

<li>
<a href="pattern_synopses.htm#Guarded Suspension">Guarded Suspension</a></li>

<br>Implementations of the Thread Pool pattern directly or indirectly use
the Guarded Suspension pattern to manage the queuing of tasks.</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Cache Consistency"></a><b>Cache Consistency</b></li>

<br>A cache can be used to keep a local copy of data from a remote data
source. From time to time, the content of the data in the remote data source
may change. You want a local cache to reflect such changes in a remote
data source. Ensure that the data in the local cache matches the remote
data source within a bounded amount of time by considering data in a cache
to have a maximum useful lifetime.
<p>Related patterns are
<ul>
<li>

<li>
<a NAME="Deep Transaction"></a><b>Deep Transaction Nesting</b></li>

<br>Implement the ability to restore the original state of objects altered
by possibly nested atomic transactions by saving the state of an object
on a stack. This technique is most commonly used for transactions that
only alter local objects or objects that are otherwise cheap to access.</ul>

to a specific state of an object by identifying its timestamp or version
number.
