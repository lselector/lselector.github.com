<p>Often 10% of features takes 90% of your programming time.&nbsp; By sacrificing
them you may make your project 10 times simpler.
<p>Same principle can be applied to the features of programming architecture.
Trying to make perfect code may make your project 10 times more complex.

<td>For example, let's say you need a report. So you asked two programmers
( <b>John Hacker</b> and <b>Bob Architect</b> ) to make it.
<p><b>John</b> <b>Hacker</b> hacked a script in one hour and emailed you
the report. You looked at the result - and realized that your original
requirements were not correct.&nbsp; So you asked to make another report
- which John emailed you in next 10 min.&nbsp; After going back and forth
5-10 times you were completely satisfied.&nbsp; You could customize the
reports providing some simple parameters on the command line or in a short
text file.&nbsp; John sent you all the scripts along with a short README
instructions text file. He also put the scripts on the web server and made
a simple text-only web page so that you can access the scripts using your
browser. The results may be sent to you via email or shown on the web page.
<p><b>Bob Architect</b>, on the other hand, is a true believer that&nbsp;
if you do things right - it will save you effort in the long run.&nbsp;
So he started to draw UML diagrams using Rational Rose or TogetherJ to
make proper Object Oriented design of the "report engine". He also decided
to make a proper GUI interface. When John already went through 10 revisions,
Bob was still busy thinking about distributing responsibilities between
his classes and interfaces, and was very proudly telling you about his
elegant design of&nbsp; "request manager", "cache manager" and "report
manager", etc., etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally he made the application work -
but it took him 10 times longer. And when he finished - you already needed
different reports.&nbsp; So you asked him to change the reports - but only
found that your new requirements don't fit well into his object model,
so he will have to start from scratch.&nbsp; Does this all sound familiar?
<p>In this scenario, first programmer sacrificed some features (GUI, OO
design) - but got the job done.&nbsp; Yes, the approach was not very pretty.&nbsp;
But it was fast, simple, allowed to move forward, and next time can be
changed as necessary.</td>

<p>Here is a wonderful story illustrating the above:&nbsp; <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/humor/eecs-difference-explained">http://philip.greenspun.com/humor/eecs-difference-explained</a>
<p>I truly believe that every time when you have to choose between "making
things right" and "making things simple", the simple path will be much
better for you over and over again.
<p>That's, for example, how we managed to build a portable <a href="emg_eeg.html">myograph
in 1989</a>. We were told, that it was not possible to do.&nbsp; But we
did it in several months. Because we didn't have a lot of resources and
couldn't do things right - but we knew the key requirements, and all other
pieces eventually fell into place.&nbsp; Our competitors having literally
100 times more resources (money, people, etc.) - had never finished the
project. Because they wanted to make things right. So they drew a plan,
distributed responsibilities, debated and agreed on a 5-year budget - and
they have never (NEVER) delivered a final product.

<p>You have to decide very carefully&nbsp; whether you really need to deliver
a finished application - or the client will be much happier with a framework
(set of tools and modules) which allows him to get functionality he needs.
<p>It is ~100 times more difficult to deliver a finished application, because
you have to test it on all supported platforms, provide documentation and
customer service, work out all small details.&nbsp; On the other side,
finished application is not flexible and may not fit customer needs. The
bigger the client - the more flexibility he may require.
<p>Thus it makes no sense to spend too much time on making a turn-key application
for a big client.&nbsp; Instead you may design a set of modules which allow
to easily construct custom applications for the client. Working with many
clients you will add more modules to the system making it more valuable
to your market.
<p>Each individual module can be small, manageable and reliable.&nbsp;
The custom application as a whole will be probably built by the client
- so you don't have to provide customer support on it's quality.
<p>Thus by shifting your goal from making a compiled product to making
a framework, you made your work 10..100 times simpler and easier - and
you made yourself 10 times more valuable to the marketplace.

<p>Today (as always) we face 2 conflicting requirements:
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp; - systems get larger and more complex</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp; - systems need to change more often -
and changes should be made faster</font>
<p>Let's think about <b><font color="#990000">amazon.com</font></b> as
an example.&nbsp; The system servers millions of clients, and the number
of clients constantly grows.&nbsp; At the same time the site changes all
the time introducing new better ways to work with clients.
<p>When things start to change faster and faster - simplicity becomes a
"live or die" requirement.
<br>In many situations you literally don't have enough time to make things
"right" or complex.
<p>What do you prefer - a simple system which does the job - or a system
which is architectured "correctly", - but never quite works, and can't
be adapted to your requirements fast enough?
<p>So it is not about "making it right" any longer.&nbsp; It is about making
it simple to change and adapt.

<p>I've heard many times that Object-Oriented paradigm is the best invention
since starting the programming era.&nbsp; I agree, it is a great thing.
<p>I also believe that the best thing about OO programming is not objects
themselves - but the culture of structuring the application in a way that
helps you program and maintain the application.&nbsp; Experience in OO
programming changes the way you think and makes you a better programmer.
<p>Or a worse programmer.&nbsp; Because when people get very familiar and
involved with objects, they start creating them everywhere - even when
they are not needed at all.&nbsp; This happens a lot when programmers use
graphical tools (like Rational Rose) and UML diagrams to structure their
applications.&nbsp; These tools make it extremely easy to create classes.&nbsp;
And programmers get in a habit of drawing new classes every time they need
some functionality.&nbsp; It is easy and addictive. And this occupation
is well paid (called "Architect").
<p>As a result I've seen a program, which instead of simply printing an
html tag was going though a process of creating a class for the tag, and
then classes for all parameters of this tag, and then running methods to
to get the tag together and print it out. This is like instead of saying
"The height is 6 feet", you would say: "The height is exp(ln(6.0)) feet".

<p>Big complex systems remind me of dinosaurs. Do you remember what happened
to them?&nbsp; And who is now dominating the Earth?
<p>The hierarchical structures of OO programs can be very useful for some
applications.&nbsp; But not always.&nbsp; For example, in big organizations
you simply can't get everything into one hierarchical structure.&nbsp;
All you can do is establish some pretty liberal general guidelines and
rules of communication. Read more here:&nbsp; <a href="distributed_computing.html">distributed_computing.html</a>.

<p>Let's say you started a web site with just one page. Then you added
some more. You working one page at a time.&nbsp; Each page is a finished
product.&nbsp; Together pages make a system - your web site. It may be
slow incremental growth. And this growth is stable, you always succeed,
because each step is simple enough and rewarding enough.
<p>This is example of evolutionary development.&nbsp; You start from a
simple bare bones single function utility. Then you write another one.
And another. You add features. You combine them together - and finally
you have a product.
<p>You allow the program to grow as a child.
<br>When the child is born - you don't know exactly what it will grow into.
<br>May be the product itself will not be a success - but one of the components
will.
<p>The art is to structure the development process into a set of easy and
rewarding small steps.
<br>The art is to structure the development process so that the product
starts to be useful at early stages.&nbsp; And then it grows and improves
with the feedback from users.
<p>If software is simple and useful - it can start with a 2-week project
- and then grow as a child.
<p>If software is not simple or not useful - it will be very difficult
for it to grow or even survive, regardless of how much time and money were
originally invested, or how "right" was its design.
<p>I wrote this - and then found that I was not the first who formulated
this. See for example <a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html">www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html</a>

<p>When I was a student (in Moscow, Russia, 1975), we were sent to suburbs
to collect vegetables (carrots). The task was simple.&nbsp; We were separated
in pairs, and each pair had a ~120 meters long row of carrots to collect
in 1 day. There was 6 pairs starting side-by-side like runners at a sport
competition. Although we were crawling on our knees, not running.&nbsp;
At the end of the day nobody finished their norm.&nbsp; In fact, most pairs
haven't even finished 50%.
<p>This continued for several days, until our manager (who was a 1st year
post-graduate student) made something very simple and very magical. Instead
of having us compete side by side along 120 meter rows - he gave each pair
a set of 6 rows 20 meter each.&nbsp; So now each pair had the same amount
of work - but it was structured as a square divided into 6 short rows.

<p>You would say - so what's the difference? Let me tell you.
<center>
<p><b><font color="#CC0000">This day all field was finished by 2 pm ! !
!</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC0000">It took only 5 hours to do what before was
taking 2 full days (16 hours) ! ! !</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC0000">This is more than 3 times faster !!</font></b></center>

<p>Why this happened?
<p>I don't know the scientific explanation. But I can tell you how it felt.
<p>You start working on one row - and pretty soon&nbsp; you see that you
can reach its middle in a short time.&nbsp; So you decide that you make
to the middle - and take a short break.&nbsp; But when you have gotten
there - you could see that it is actually very easy to finish the row -
and then take a break.&nbsp; And when you made 1st row - you see that now
only 5 left. And you estimated how long it took you to finish the previous
row - so you can tell when you will finish the next row. etc.
<p>The work started to feel manageable. And everybody rather enjoyed the
process. It was addictive.
<p>So, do you want to increase your effectiveness 3 fold?
<br>Then plan your work as a set of simple manageable self-contained and
self rewarding steps.

<p>Let's say we have 2 solutions to a problem:
<br>&nbsp; Solution "S" - simple, easy, cheap, flexible, reliable.
<br>&nbsp; Solution "P" - politically beneficial, although very expensive,
new (not proven to work), hardest to implement and maintain.
<p><b><font color="#3333FF">An individual developer usually will select
the "S" (simple) solution.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#3333FF">A manager in a big organization will, on the
contrary, always (ALWAYS !) select the political ("P") solution.</font></b>
<p>Let's formulate this as <b><u>The First Selector's Law:</u></b>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#CC0000">Managers in big organizations ALWAYS reject
simple proven solutions</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC0000">in favor of new hard and expensive solutions.</font></b></center>

<p>Please note, that managers are NOT stupid. They are doing the right
political move in order to survive in the organization, get more people
under them, get promoted, increase visibility and weight of their department,
etc. Yes, they are doing the right thing !&nbsp; This right thing may be
not the best thing for the organization or the product - but managers will
never say this.&nbsp; Instead they will write documents striving to prove
that they are working in the best interests of the organization.
<p>Quite natural consequence of this law is that in spite of trashing millions
of dollars, managers usually don't lose their jobs. On the contrary - they
usually get promoted, and receive more resources (people and money) to
continue their work.
<p><b><u>Practical advice:</u></b>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#CC0000">Never try to convince a manager to use "S"
(simple)</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC0000">solution instead of "P" (political) solution.</font></b></center>

<p>Why not? Because you will create a conflict. Manager will have to chose
between keeping you and making the "right thing". Do you really want to
get fired?

<p>&nbsp; - use 2-weeks criterion and ELF formula to avoid going "heavy
weight" path
<br>&nbsp; - use 90/10 rule to slash-off unnecessary requirements
<br>&nbsp; - select the best tool for the job (or create one)
<br>&nbsp; - the system ideally should include not only tools to do the
job, but also tools to change itself to fit to changing requirements.
<br>&nbsp; - let the program grow as a child.
<br>&nbsp; - plan your work as a set of simple manageable self-contained
and self rewarding steps.
<br>&nbsp; - be careful with promoting simple solutions in a large organization.
