<td><font color="#CC0000">1. In the beginning GOD created the Bit and the
Byte. And from those he created the Word.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#CC0000">2. And there were two Bytes in the Word; and nothing
else existed. And God separated the One from the Zero; and he saw it was
Good.</font>

<br><font color="#CC0000">&nbsp;3. And God said - Let the Data be; And
so it happened. And God said - Let the Data go to their proper places.
And he created floppy disks and hard disks and compact disks.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#CC0000">4. And God said - Let the computers be, so there
would be a place to put floppy disks and hard disks and compact disks.
Thus God created computers and called them hardware.&nbsp;</font>
<br><img SRC="images/companim.gif" BORDER=0 height=88 width=106 align=RIGHT>
<br><font color="#CC0000">5. And there was no Software yet. But God created
programs; small and big...And told them - Go and multiply yourselves and
fill all the Memory.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#CC0000">6. And God said -I will create the Programmer;
And the Programmer will make new programs and govern over the computers
and programs and Data.&nbsp;</font>
<br><img SRC="images/jesus.jpg" BORDER=0 height=297 width=169 align=LEFT>
<br><font color="#CC0000">7. And God created the Programmer; and put him
at Data Center; And God showed the Programmer the Catalog Tree and said
You can use all the volumes and sub-volumes but DO NOT USE Windows.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#CC0000">8. And God said - It is not Good for the programmer
to be alone. He took a bone from the Programmer's body and created a creature
that would look up at the Programmer; and admire the Programmer; and love
the things the Programmer does; And God called the creature: the User.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#CC0000">9. And the Programmer and the User were left under
the naked DOS and it was Good.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#CC0000">10. But Bill was smarter than all the other creatures
of God. And Bill said to the User - Did God really tell you not to run
any programs ?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#CC0000">11. And the User answered - God told us that we
can use every program and every piece of Data but told us not to run Windows
or we will die.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#CC0000">12. And Bill said to the User - How can you talk
about something you did not even try. The moment you run Windows you will
become equal to God. You will be able to create anything you like by a
simple click of your mouse.&nbsp;</font>
<br><img SRC="images/mary.jpg" BORDER=0 height=288 width=157 align=RIGHT>
<br><font color="#CC0000">13. And the User saw that the fruits of the Windows
were nicer and easier to use. And the User saw that any knowledge was useless
- since Windows could replace it.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#CC0000">14. So the User installed the Windows on his computer;
and said to the Programmer that it was good.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#CC0000">15. And the Programmer immediately started to
look for new drivers. And God asked him - What are you looking for? And
the Programmer answered: " I am looking for new drivers because I can not
find them in the DOS". And God said :" Who told you need drivers? Did you
run Windows?" And the Programmer said :" It was Bill who told us to !"&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#CC0000">16. And God said to Bill - Because of what you
did you will be hated by all the creatures. And the User will always be
unhappy with you. And you will always sell Windows.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#CC0000">17. And God said to the User - Because of what
you did, the Windows will disappoint you and eat up all your Resources;
and you will have to use lousy programs; and you will always rely on the
Programmers help.&nbsp;</font>
<br><img SRC="images/christma.gif" height=168 width=120 align=LEFT>
<br><font color="#CC0000">18. And God said to the Programmer - Because
you listened to the User you will never be happy. All your programs will
have errors and you will have to fix them and fix them to the end of time.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#CC0000">19. And God threw them out of the Data Center
and locked the door and secured it with a password.&nbsp;</font>
