<br>- "The only way to break the testing addiction cycle is to bite the
bullet and allocate the upstream resources needed for quality assurance
on a project."
<br>- "The architecture should contain a high-level discussion of the major
design alternatives that were considered, the reasons that the selected
approaches were chosen, and the reasons other alternatives were not selected."
<br>- "Once you realize that the goal of architecture is to reduce complexity,
it becomes clear that the architect must focus as much on what to leave
out of the software as on what to put in."

Productive Projects and Teams</font></b>, 2nd Ed. - by Tom Demarco, Timothy
Lister
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><font color="#3333FF">Classics - major issues of software development
are human, not technical. Joyful reading.</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">Main ideas: give smart people physical space,
intellectual responsibility and strategic direction. DeMarco and Lister
advocate private offices and windows.&nbsp; They advocate creating teams
with aligned goals and limited non-team work. They advocate managers finding
good staff and putting their fate in the hands of those staff. The manager's
function, they write, is <b><u>not to make people work but to make it possible
for people to work</u></b>.</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">- "Ever wonder why everybody at Microsoft gets
their own office, with walls and a door that shuts? It's in there [ in
the book]. Why do managers give so much leeway to their teams to get things
done? That's in there too. Why are there so many ... teams at Microsoft
that are remarkably productive? Mainly because Bill Gates has built a company
full of managers who read Peopleware."</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">- Peopleware's persuasiveness comes from its
numbers - from its simple, cold, numerical demonstration that improving
programmers' environments will make them more productive. The numbers in
Peopleware come from DeMarco and Lister's Coding War Games, a series of
competitions to complete given coding and testing tasks in minimal time
and with minimal defects. The Games have consistently confirmed various
known facts of the software game. For instance, the best coders outperform
the ten-to-one, but their pay seems only weakly linked to their performance.
But DeMarco and Lister also found that the best-performing coders had larger,
quieter, more private workspaces. It is for this one empirical finding
that Peopleware is best known.</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">- authors offer a theory: that managers should
help programmers, designers, writers and other brainworkers to reach a
state that psychologists call "<b><u>flow</u></b>" - an almost meditative
condition where people can achieve important leaps towards solving complex
problems. It's the state where you start work, look up, and notice that
three hours have passed. But it takes time - perhaps fifteen minutes on
average - to get into this state. And DeMarco and Lister that today's typical
noisy, cubicled, Dilbertesque office rarely allows people 15 minutes of
uninterrupted work. In other words, the world is full of places where a
highly-paid and dedicated programmer or creative artist can spend a full
day without ever getting any hard-core work. Put another way, the world
is full of cheap opportunities for people to make their co-workers more
productive, just by building their offices a bit smarter. (from review
by David Walker).</font></td>

<p>Professor Northcote Parkinson (1909-1993) - British historian, author,
and formulator of "Parkinson's Law," the satiric dictum that "Work expands
to fill the time available for its completion."
<p>"Administrators make work for each other, he said, so that they can
multiply the number of their subordinates and enhance their prestige."
<p>His second law was intended as a jibe at government functionaries, who
he thought were inclined to expand their own ranks indefinitely, so long
as taxes could be raised.
<p>Written in a deadpan but mercilessly funny style, Parkinson's Economist
essays were issued in book form in Parkinson's Law, or The Pursuit of Progress
(1958). Apart from the books that made him famous, Parkinson wrote numerous
historical works, including the critically acclaimed The Evolution of Political
Thought (1958).

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#CC0000">Work expands so as to fill the time available for
its completion.</font><font color="#000000"> This law has many consequences.
For example, it shows why the British Colonial Office has grown in number
of employees as the actual number of colonies declined - so that it employed
more people when the number of colonies had been reduced to zero than when
they were at their highest number.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#CC0000">Expenditure rises to meet income.</font><font color="#000000">
( </font>Unit costs of public services tend to increase to consume the
available funding. <font color="#000000">Data expands to fill the space
available for storage. Network traffic expands to fill the available bandwidth,
etc. Unfortunately this law is not applicable to our wallet nor to its
contents. Pity.)</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Expansion means complexity, and complexity - decay.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Policies designed to increase production increase
employment; policies designed to increase employment do everything but.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Democracy equals inflation (people vote for higher
pay rather than for increased production)</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Delay is the deadliest form of denial.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">The matters most debated tend to be the minor ones
where everybody understands the issues.</font></li>

<td>Human, not technical problems seem to be at the root of software projects
failure.
<br>Parkinson?s law: ?Work expands to fill the time allocated for it.?
<br>Management response: set impossibly optimistic delivery dates.
<br>Estimates actually seem counter-productive (people do more without
estimates).
<br><b><u>The Solutions:</u></b>
<br>- <b>Build a close-knit team, with shared responsibility</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Programmers do the estimating
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Make a cult of quality
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Provide lots of satisfying closure
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Build a sense of eliteness
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Allow and encourage individuality
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Provide strategic but not tactical direction
<br>- <b>Preserve and protect successful teams</b></td>

<td>Software people at all levels perceive themselves to be equally intelligent,

<br>A leaf-node worker is more expert than any manager, making it difficult
to engage in a technical argument.
<br>People with bad ideas and low productivity often think of themselves
as supremely capable.
<br>As for programmers who are supremely capable, there is no reason to
expect consensus from them.
<br><b><u>Therefore, the successful software engineering manager...</u></b>
<br>Achieves credibility with staff by participating in the work - whether
by coding, designing data models, writing system design documents, journal
articles.
<br>Delegates decisions to small groups that include someone trusted and
competent.
<br>Involves key project stakeholders (customer reps) in decisions, so
that developers perceive their accountability.

have to break everything in order to make it work better).
<br><b><u>Therefore, the successful software engineering manager...</u></b>

acquired and communicated to the team.
<br>Considers peers' assessments of one another.

trivial amounts of time - do the hard stuff first!
<p>The prime source of ego-gratification for programmers is to have other
programmers admire their work.
<br>Open-source software projects thus have a big recruiting advantage.
<br>Make sure team members get to work with one another's code. Rather
than silo the project by assigning one module to each programmer, have
them work in small groups and share code across groups.</td>

<p><b><u>What kind of working environment is necessary for programmer satisfaction?</u></b>
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC" >
<tr>
<td>Good programmers want to achieve; therefore, removing barriers to achievement
is the most important step.
<br>Programmers dread elaborate process, endless meetings, and layers of
marketing approval before a product can be shipped.
<br>Adopt a lightweight process and flatten the project management structure.
<p>A good physical working environment is essential.
<br>Your business success will depend on the extent to which programmers
<u>essentially
live at your office</u>.
<br>For this to be a common choice, your office had <u>better be nicer
than the average programmer's home</u>.
<br>Great programmers get a lot of positive reinforcement from their work
itself.
<br>They write some code and immediately can see it in action. That keeps
them at work for hours.
<br><u>Encourage frequent builds</u>, <u>keep the system integrated</u>,
and <u>require that all code be tested as soon as it is writte</u>n.
<br>Do these things and programmers will usually see their code working
as it should. Neglect these things and they will have to spend hours figuring
out why it doesn't work.</td>

<td>Software engineers respond best to management by a fellow programmer

<br>Biggest risk of having a manager work as a programmer is that s/he

<p>Here are some ideas summarized from listening to Jesse Erlbaum.&nbsp;
Jesse Erlbaum is the Chief Technology Officer for the Vanguard Media Corporation
(<a href="http://www.vm.com">www.vm.com</a>), located in New York City,
where he has worked since 1994. Vanguard Media develops custom software
for a variety of clients, from the WPP Group to Time, Inc.
<p>Most of our work is not rocket science. We are using operating systems,
programming languages, databases, which were invented ~ 25 years ago. Most
of our applications are pretty standard and simple:&nbsp; Some back-end
SQL database, some browser front-end, and some code in the middle.
<p>Major clients in NY City - Finance, Publishing, Advertising
<p>Difference in dev.time/quality of the result between languages (religious
arguments Perl vs Java, etc.) ~ 10-15%
<br>Difference between programmers and processes ~ 1000%
<p>"Don't build it - you will not need it."
<p><b><u>Talking to client - agree on 2 phase approach:</u></b>
<br>0 - pre-sign - agree on 2-phase approach
<br>1st phase - preparing specifications and estimate
<br>2nd phase - actually implementing
<p><b><u>Specifications:</u></b>
<br>&nbsp; - are prepared <b><u>involving end-users</u></b> (and developers)
<br>&nbsp; - constitute ~25 ..50% of total development costs
<br>&nbsp; - allows to give a time/money estimate (don't overpromise and
don't take unnecessary responsibilities)
<p><b><u>For a typical web-based application:</u></b>
<br>&nbsp; 1. UI Screens (just buttons, form fields and links - may be
HTML-templates)
<br>&nbsp; 2. Data model
<br>&nbsp; 3. State Transition Diagrams (1 state per screen - just drawing,
or using simple software like <a href="http://www.objectdomain.com/ - Object Domain">www.objectdomain.com</a>)
<br>&nbsp; 4. Textual description
<br>&nbsp; 5. Revised Estimate and schedule
<p><b><u>Implementing:</u></b>
<br>1. Each developer has his/her own environment absolutely equivalent
to production.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No need to make any changes to the code during production
release.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apache server config file is generated automatically
for each user (using HTML::Template, by the way).
<br>2. Use CVS for code, modules, documentation, etc.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CVS can not guarantee anything - it just helps people
to communicate.
<br>3. Put main reusable modules in public domain (CPAN) to avoid legal
explanations.
<br>4. Use Unix to build reliable applications => low maintenance.
<br>5. Use Apache &amp; MySQL.
<br>6. Use HTML::Template to separate the work of Programmers and Designers.
<br>7. Use CGI::Application to properly structure pieces of the application.
<br>8. Prepare documentation (so that your mother can understand) and keep
it in devdocs directory
<br>9. keep DBLOG - textual description of all changes in the database,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in which environment they were implemented, and
cut/paste code to implement those changes
<br>10. keep working versions of public modules in CVS too.

ITIL - the IT Infrastructure Library. It is a set of best practices on organizing IT process. Originally created in 1980 at the Office of Government Commerce in UK. You can get certified in it. Current ITIL is a set of 5 main books which you can buy for ~600, or as a PDF for ~$430. They are:

<ul>
  <li>ITIL Service Strategy</li>
  <li> ITIL Service Design</li>
  <li> ITIL Service Transition</li>
  <li> ITIL Service Operation</li>
  <li> ITIL Continual Service Improvement<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>You can learn more here:</p>

  <li><a href="http://www.itilcommunity.com/">http://www.itilcommunity.com/</a> - excellent free information source</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also buy the ITIL books (and 3rd party books) on amazon - just search for ITIL.
<p>For a good introduction into main concepts you can read this book: <span class="style1">&quot;IT Service Management: An Introduction&quot;</span> (ISBN 9080671347)

<p>The good thing about ITIL is that it covers a lot of ground, so it is valuable introduction for a new manager. There is also such thing as ITIL certification.

<p>  On the negative side,  ITIL was criticized, because its   approach 
  is too centered on the IT itself, and less focused on what IT   does 
for a customer or for a business.
<p>There are many vendors providing software (free or commercial) to implement different parts of ITIL recommendations. See for example here:<BR>

</ul>
<p>The people behind RUP - Ivar Jacobson, Grady Booch, James Rumbaug, et al - creators of UML (Unified Modeling Language). In RUP they applied the same object-oriented modeling to software development process. This is a big improvement in comparison to monolitic &quot;waterfall&quot; style methods, which are prone to failure.</p>
<p>Here are some concepts of RUP:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The main building blocks: Roles (who), Work Products (what), Tasks (how).</li>
  <li> Within each iteration, the tasks are categorized into  9 disciplines: 
    <ul>
      <li> 6  &quot;engineering disciplines&quot; (Business Modeling, Requirements, Analysis and Design, Implementation, Test, Deployment)</li>
      <li> 3 supporting disciplines (Configuration and Change Management, Project Management, Environment)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Four project lifecycle phases (Inception, Elaboration, Construction, Transition (prod.release))</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Note: The Project Management discipline contains a number of other Plans and Artifacts:
    <ul>
      <li> The Phase Plan (The Software Development Plan) - where each phase includes plans for  measurement,   risk management,  problem resolution, and  product acceptance.</li>
      <li> The Iteration Plan - time-sequenced assignment of tasks and resources,  dependencies. Tracking of progress, lists of scenarios or use cases, list of risks, list of changes, etc.</li>

<p>Agile Software Development -  a set of methodologies for software development where, instead of long-term structured planning, the work is done  in small increments (1..4 weeks) followed by a review and re-planning as needed  to better align with customer needs. The approach is based on self-organizing teamwork, frequent testing, small-team accountability.
<p>The principles of agile development were proposed in 2001 and posted here:
<a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html</a> . Here is a local copy for convenience:

      <li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in 
        development. Agile processes harness change for 
        the customer's competitive advantage.</li>
      <li>Deliver working software frequently, from a 
        couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a 
        preference to the shorter timescale.</li>
      <li>Business people and developers must work 
        together daily throughout the project.</li>
      <li>Build projects around motivated individuals. 
        Give them the environment and support they need, 
        and trust them to get the job done.</li>
      <li>The most efficient and effective method of 
        conveying information to and within a development 
        team is face-to-face conversation.</li>
      <li>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</li>
      <li>Agile processes promote sustainable development.

<p><b><u>Practical solution which I've seen working pretty well:</u></b>
<br>1. Use CVS for version control to move files between development, QA,
Pre-production and production stages.
<br>2. Use Autosys-scheduled shell and Perl scripts
<br>3. Use rsync (which is better than rdist) instead of ftp to distribute
files

<br>6. Parse cvs logs to make mailing lists of developers contributed chagnes
- and automatically notify them (especially in case of problems).
<br>7. Have scripts to deploy the whole system (including shared libraries,
core applications, misc. other applications) - or only a small part of
the system.

<p>There are many way to document your project.
<br>I like to make a local web site where I document everything manually.
<br>User manuals usually are prepared as MS Word documents or PDF files
for Adobe Acrobat.
<p>One good way to make documentaion is by using DocBook XML Publishing:

<p>Literate programming is a methodology that combines a programming language
with a documentation language, thereby making programs more robust, more
portable, more easily maintained, and arguably more fun to write than programs
that are written only in a high-level language. The main idea is to treat
a program as a piece of literature, addressed to human beings rather than
to a computer. The program is also viewed as a hypertext document, rather
like the World Wide Web.
<p>Literate programming was introduced by Donald E. Knuth (), Professor
Emeritus of The Art of Computer Programming at Stanford University. D.Knuth
is mostly known as an author of famous 3-volume set "The Art of Computer
Programming".
