<p>Here is the plan for next 1-2 weeks (that's all you need):
<p>First, you need to Install some software that I gave you.
<p>Create those directories:
<br>AAA_work\
<br>AAA_work\yourdomain.com\
<br>AAA_downloads\
<br>AAA_junk\
<br>CDpublic\
<br>CD-unix\
<p>copy these 2 directories:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; e-read
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; tools-1
<br>from your Soft CD to CDpublic\ directory
<p>copy everything from your Unix CD to CD-unix\ directory
<p>go to CDpublic directory in the DOS prompt and run this command to remove
<br>Read Only where possible:
<p>ATTRIB -R -A -H /S
<p>Then remove CDs.
<br>Now proceed with installations from CDpublic\tools-1\ directory:
<p>1. Netscape Communicator
<br>2. NoteTab
<br>3. Adobe Photoshop 5.5
<br>4. CuteFTP 3
<br>5. Telnet (CRT)
<br>6. Adobe Acrobat 4
<br>7. Winzip
<br>8. Perl
<br>9. Macromedia Dreamweaver
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Now in your AAA_work\ directory create a text file:
<br>&nbsp; "home.html"
<br>and make this file your home page in both browsers.
<p>In Netscape Edit Menu / Preferences
<br>Coose Composer / Publishing
<br>and uncheck (make blank) both checkboxes
<br>(maintain links and keep images with tha page).
<br>THEY SHOULD BE CLEAR.
<p>Create connections from your CuteFTP and CRT-telnet to your web server
<br>www.yourdomain.com
<br>login:
<br>passwd:
<p>download all files and subdirectories from your
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yourdomain/www/
<br>subdirectory on your server to your
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AAA_work\yourdomain.com\
<br>on your computer
<p>Learn to:
<p>- Use Netscape composer to edit html pages and FTP them to your web
site
<p>- add useful links to your home.html page
<br>(including links to your site at home and on the internet, to my site,
to
<br>e-read on your computer)
<p>- Learn to use Adobe Photoshop (ther are lessons in e-read)
<p>- Learn to use telnet (move around using cd and ls commands, reading,
<br>editing (vi), creating and removing files, renaming, pipe, grep, ps,
etc. -
<br>basic shell commands)
<p>- Create your own web site with the following pages:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; index.html - your main page
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; resume.html - your resume
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; html.html - page about html design
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; graphics.html - about graphics
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; javascript - about javascript + some examples
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; perl.html - about perl
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; cpp.html - about C++
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; email.cgi - to send emails
<p>Note:
<br>&nbsp;- use key-words / metatags on every page
<br>&nbsp;- have a navigation system
<p>While doing this also play with Dreamweaver.
<p>Next step - meeting with me to learn:
<br>&nbsp;- perl and HTTP/CGI.
<br>&nbsp;- mysql prompt utility
<br>Next - simple perl and CGI scripts
<br>&nbsp; (including interface to the database)
<p>Next - Interview training and resume broadcasting
<br>Next - 2 interviews/day
<p>Yours
<br>Lev
