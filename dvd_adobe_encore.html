<p><strong><u>Toolbox menu on the left top:</u></strong><br>
  Image (Adobe Online) - pop-ups the browser</p>
<p>Selection Tool (dark arrow) and Direct Selection tool (white arrow) - to select 
  layers.<br>
  The difference:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection Tool will select the whole button object (a button, 
  its text, subpictures)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct Selection Tool allows to select individual layers within 
  the button.</p>
<p>Each object (in a menu) is on a separate layer.<br>
  Several objects may be combined in a set (a button is a set).</p>
<p>You can select objects by clicking or by dragging a marquee box around the 
  object.<br>
  Use <strong>Shift-Click</strong> to unselect a selected object.<br>
  Use <strong>Shift-Click</strong> to select several objects.<br>
  <br>
  More ways to select: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Layers tab to activate it (or choose Window &gt; Layers), 
  and click the object's layer or the layer set. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Shift-click each additional layer or layer set you want to select. 
</p>
<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: selection handles appear on all the selected 
  items in the Menu Editor window. In addition to selection handles, button sets 
  display a bounding box. This bounding box encompasses all elements within the 
  button set and indicates the hot-zone or highlight region for the button.<br>
  <br>
  <em><strong>Note</strong></em>: you can undo changes by pressing ^Z (Chose Edit 
  &gt; Undo, Edit &gt; Redo, Edit &gt; History ...).</p>
<p><strong><u>Moving, copying, and deleting objects</u></strong><br>
  - <strong>drag</strong> with a mouse<br>
  - <strong>Shift-drag</strong> to constrain the movement horizontally, vertically, 
  or diagonally<br>
  - <strong>Alt-drag</strong> to create a copy and move it to a new location<br>
  - <strong>arrow keys</strong> - move selected object by 1 pixel<br>
  - <strong>Shift+arrow key</strong> - move selected object by 10 pixels<br>
  - use standard <strong>^C, ^X, ^V</strong> to copy, cut, or paste an object, 
  or<strong> ^D</strong> to make a duplicate (see Edit menu). You can paste an 
  object into a different layer set or even in a different menu. To move or copy 
  an object into another layer set, you select the object, do <strong>^C</strong>, 
  then <em><u>select another object in the list of objects under a Layers tab</u></em> 
  - and do <strong>^V</strong>.<br>
  - move selected object forward or back in the stacking order (Choose <strong>Object 
  &gt; Arrange &gt; ...</strong>). Note: layers within layer sets change levels 
  only within the layer set.<br>
  <br>
  - align / distribute several selected objects horisontally or vertically <br>
  (Choose <strong>Object &gt; Align &gt; ...</strong> or <strong>Object &gt; Distribute&gt; 
  ...</strong>). <br>
  You can align the left, center, or right - or to top, middle, or bottom. Alignment 
  always occurs within a rectangle, either the Title Safe area or the bounding 
  box that encompasses all the objects. You can either align the objects relative 
  to each other or align them to the Title Safe area. Note: A check mark next 
  to the Relative to Safe Areas indicates it is turned on. To turn the option 
  off, choose it again (Object &gt; Align&gt; Relative to Safe Areas).<br>
  <br>
  - adjust size of one or several selected objects with the mouse by <strong>dragging 
  by a handle</strong>.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>Shift-drag</strong> a handle to proportionally 
  scale the object. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>Alt-drag</strong> a handle to scale from the 
  object's center point. (The center point maintains its position on the page.) 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <strong>Shift-Alt-drag</strong> to scale proportionally 
  from the object's center point. (The center point maintains its position on 
  the page.)<br>
  <br>
  <u><strong>Adding text to menus</strong></u> <br>
  You can type text either horizontally or vertically (select either the vertical 
  or horizontal text tool from the toolbox). Also if you just click and then type 
  - the text is unconstrained. But if you push mouse button, drag to define a 
  bounding box, release the button - and they type - then the text will be limited 
  to this bounding box.</p>
<p>To change the font size, etc. - choose Window &gt; Character.<br>
  Note: You can change the orientation of vertical text using the Rotate Character 
  option in the Character Palette menu.<br>
  Note: To resize the text bounding box - select either the vertical or horizontal 
  text tool from the toolbox and click the text to select the text block. Then 
  position the cursor over a selection handle, when it changes to a double-headed 
  arrow, drag the handle to resize the bounding box. The text reflows within the 
  box.</p>
<p> <u><strong>Working with Adobe Photoshop:</strong></u> <br>
  Adobe Encore DVD is designed to work directly with Adobe Photoshop to build 
  and edit menus and buttons. Adobe Encore DVD lets you take full advantage of 
  the design capabilities of Adobe Photoshop. You can create entire menus or elements 
  for menus (such as buttons and backgrounds) in Adobe Photoshop and import them 
  directly into Adobe Encore DVD. Adobe Encore DVD maintains the layers and layer 
  sets you created. If you follow the layer naming convention, Adobe Encore DVD 
  will automatically recognize button sets, subpictures, video thumbnails, and 
  text layers. Once imported, you can edit or modify the menu as you would any 
  menu created in Adobe Encore DVD. </p>
<p><strong><em>Menu size:</em></strong> set the size of your background images 
  and menus to match the frame dimensions of your TV standard (NTSC or PAL). Photoshop 
  includes preset image sizes for NTSC and PAL DV projects.</p>
<p><strong><em>Button size:</em></strong> create buttons at least 70 x 60 pixels 
  to guarantee their visibility on a television. </p>
<p><strong><em>Graphic elements:</em></strong> create buttons and other graphic 
  elements (such as logos) at the largest size needed for the DVD. It is better 
  to have to scale an object down if it is used in a smaller size in some places. 
  (Scaling images up can cause quality loss; scaling images down does not.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Square pixels vs. rectangular pixels:</em></strong> if you create 
  menus or backgrounds using square pixels, it is best to size them using the 
  Photoshop preset image sizes. When Adobe Encore DVD builds the DVD, it automatically 
  compensates for the change in pixel dimensions. Thus, when the viewer plays 
  the DVD in the rectangular pixel environment of the television, the menus will 
  not appear squashed.</p>
<p><strong><em>RGB color:</em></strong> Create your images using RGB color.</p>
<p><strong><em>Horizontal lines:</em></strong> set lines at 3 pixels or greater. 
  Horizontal lines thinner than 3 pixels flicker when displayed on a television 
  screen. </p>
<p><strong><em>Font size:</em></strong> use a font size of 20 points or greater 
  to ensure that the viewer can comfortably read titles and button text.</p>
<p><strong><em>NTSC colors:</em></strong> use only NTSC-safe colors. Adobe Photoshop 
  has a special filter that shifts your image colors to the NTSC-safe range. </p>
<p><strong><em>Predefined Prefixes:</em></strong> For Adobe Encore DVD to recognize 
  the components of a menu from Photoshop, you must add predefined prefixes to 
  the layer names. Adobe Encore DVD uses the prefixes to identify the layers as 
  button sets, video thumbnails, and subpictures. In this way, you can import 
  a finished menu, ready for use in the project. You can also manipulate and change 
  elements from within Adobe Encore DVD.<br>

<br>
<br>
<u><strong>Creating a video thumbnail button:</strong></u> 
<p>A button can contain a thumbnail image of the video to which it is linked. 
  The key is to create a video thumbnail layer with the layer name prefix (%). 
  The image on the layer serves as a placeholder for the video. The video remains 
  rectangular regardless of the shape of the image layer. You can, however, use 
  masks to overlay the thumbnail. The size of the image determines the size of 
  the video displayed in the menu. (If the image is not rectangular, Adobe Encore 
  DVD calculates the smallest rectangle in which the image could fit.) Until you 
  link the button to the video, you see only the placeholder image. </p>
<p>The thumbnail image can be still or moving. Turning video thumbnails on or 
  off is a menu setting - use the Animate Buttons option in the Properties palette 
  (Menu mode). You can designate a specific frame using the Poster option in the 
  Chapter mode of the Properties palette.</p>
<p><strong><u>Menu &gt; Edit in Photoshop:</u></strong></p>
<p>Without closing the project, you can jump to Photoshop to refine any menu, 
  even menus created in Adobe Encore DVD. Once you save the changes in Photoshop, 
  they automatically appear in Adobe Encore DVD. </p>
<p>Select a menu in Encore. Then choose <strong>Menu &gt; Edit in Photoshop</strong>. 
  Photoshop opens, displaying the selected menu. Make changes as necessary and 
  save (Flie &gt; Save). Photoshop saves the file to the project folder. It does 
  not overwrite the original file that you imported into your project.<br>
  Note: When you import a menu into Adobe Encore DVD, it creates a copy of the 
  menu. When you save the menu in Photoshop, it saves your changes to the copy. 
  If you want to update the original as well, it is important to first save the 
  copy so that your project contains the revised menu. Once saved, you can use 
  the Save As command on the File menu in Photoshop to save the changes to the 
  original file. </p>
<strong><u>Creating subpictures and color sets:</u></strong> 
<p>A subpicture defines the highlighting used when a button is selected, activated, 
  or in its normal (unselected) state. All the predesigned buttons included with 
  Adobe Encore DVD come with subpictures.</p>
<p><strong><u>Setting remote control buttons:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Routing</strong> is the button-to-button path the cursor follows when 
  moved by the arrow buttons of a remote control. For most projects, Adobe Encore 
  DVD can determine the standard routing pattern for you (you can customize routing 
  manually too). </p>
<p> <u><strong>Changing the automatic routing preferences:</strong></u></p>
<p>Adobe Encore DVD provides four (4) <strong>preset routing patterns</strong>. 
  The default routing is a circular movement through the buttons on the same row 
  or column. Right or left arrows move across the row in the appropriate direction, 
  returning to the beginning of the same row. Up and down arrows follow the same 
  rules and move up or down until the end of the column, returning to the top 
  or bottom of the column in a circular fashion.</p>
<p>Using a preferences setting, you can change the routing so that when an arrow 
  button reaches the end of a row or column it moves to the beginning of the next 
  row or column. You can also change the routing to be only horizontal or vertical, 
  limiting movement, for example, across a row and not up or down. </p>
<p> To change the routing preferences, choose <strong>Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; 
  Menus</strong> click the routing preferences to select or deselect them, choose 
  the desired wrap options from the appropriate pop-up menu. Click OK.</p>

<p>Most DVDs consist of several features. You arrange the necessary assets of 
  each feature (video clips, still images, audio clips, and subtitles) in timelines. 
  The timeline shows you the duration of each asset and its placement in time 
  relative to the other assets. Video, audio, and subtitles all appear on separate 
  tracks. You may have several timelines. You link to a timeline from menus - 
  you can mark specific locations in the feature by using chapter points and position 
  subtitles to match the video or still images. 
<p> <u><strong>Moving around in the timeline:</strong></u></p>
<p>To contract or expand the timeline:<br>
  - click the <em><strong>zoom-in</strong></em> or <em><strong>zoom-out</strong></em> 
  icon<br>
  - drag the <em><strong>zoom slider</strong></em> right or left<br>
  - select the <em><strong>zoom tool from the toolbox</strong></em> and <strong>click</strong> 
  or <em><strong>click-and-drag</strong></em> over the area of the timeline you 
  want to expand; you can also <em><strong>Alt-click</strong></em> to contract 
  the timeline.</p>
<p> The <strong>Timeline</strong> and <strong>Monitor</strong> windows work in 
  tandem. When you change the timecode in one, the other window changes as well. 
  <strong>Drag the current-time indicator</strong> to a new location on the timeline 
  ruler, or <strong>click a new location</strong> on the timeline ruler. The current-time 
  indicator moves to the new location. Or you can move numerically - just position 
  the selection tool over either the Timeline or Source timecode value in the 
  Timeline window, and either drag to the left or right - or click the timecode 
  value, type a new time, and press Enter.</p>
<p>Once an asset has been added to a timeline, it becomes a clip (video, audio, 
  subtitle, or still image clip) and the Properties palette displays the relevant 
  information about it when you select it. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: A single asset can be used multiple times in a project, 
  with each occurrence appearing as a unique clip with its own properties. </p>
<p> <strong>Note</strong>: The <strong>Encoded</strong> option shows the size 
  of the clip after transcoding or the estimated size if not yet transcoded (&quot;est&quot; 
  follows the name).</p>
<p> <u><strong>Adding video and still images to a timeline:</strong></u></p>
<p>Choose <strong>Timeline &gt; New Timeline</strong>. Drag the desired video 
  or still image from the Project tab to the video track of the new timeline. 
  Video clip will go to the beginning of the timeline, regardless of where in 
  the timeline you release the mouse. Still images will go where you place them. 
  Chapter point will be created at the beginning of the still image or video clip.</p>
<p> The timeline includes a track for visual media which may contain either <strong>a 
  single video clip</strong> or <strong>multiple still images</strong>. The default 
  length for still images, which can be changed in the Timeline preferences, is 
  6 seconds. You can also change the duration of individual still images directly 
  in the timeline.</p>
<p>The timeline lets you use up to eight audio tracks and 32 subtitle tracks. 
  A DVD player plays only one of each track at a time. When multiple audio and 
  subtitle tracks are available, the Audio 1 track is used for the soundtrack 
  included with video. Additional audio and subtitle tracks are generally used 
  for voiceovers, dubbing, and subtitles in other languages. Because subtitles 
  are actually a full-screen image that overlays the video, you can use subtitle 
  tracks to add pointers and arrows, to mask or highlight areas, or even to add 
  simple animation. (Animations should be limited to 5 frames per second to ensure 
  smooth playback.)</p>
<p>The player stores the audio and subtitle track selections so that once a viewer 
  specifies an audio track, for example, the player plays the correct audio track 
  for all features (timelines) in the program. Menu buttons reference tracks by 
  number. If a timeline does not contain the specified track, the DVD player defaults 
  to the Audio 1 track for the rest of the project, even if subsequent timelines 
  contain the originally specified track. </p>
<p>If you have more than one feature with several audio and/or subtitle tracks 
  (such as language voiceovers and subtitles), use the same track for like audio 
  or subtitles throughout the project. For example, all Spanish subtitles should 
  be on the same numbered subtitle track in each feature, and likewise, all director's 
  comments should be on the same numbered audio track. </p>
<p>To add audio to a timeline just drag the desired audio clip from the Project 
  tab to the timeline, just below the video track. To activate an audio track, 
  click the box next to the track name. When you place an audio file in the timeline, 
  Adobe Encore DVD automatically snaps it to the beginning of the track. You can 
  change the start point within the source audio file, but the file must start 
  at the beginning of the timeline.</p>
<p>To add audio track choose <strong>Timeline &gt; Add Audio Track</strong> or 
  <strong>right-click in the audio track</strong> and choose <strong>Add Audio 
  Track</strong>. </p>
<p> To remove audio track, select the audio track you want to remove by clicking 
  its name on the left side of the timeline, then choose <strong>Timeline &gt; 
  Remove Audio Track</strong> or <strong>right-click the audio track and choose 
  Remove Audio Track</strong>. </p>
<p><strong><u>Adding chapter points to the timeline:</u></strong></p>
<p>You add chapter points to mark a specific frame in a video - to link to this 
  point from menus, buttons, and other timlines. Chapter points are numbered sequentially 
  automatically - and renumbered if you insert a chapter point between two existing 
  points. To help identify chapter points, you can give them descriptive names 
  and store notes about them. Adobe Encore DVD always inserts a chapter point 
  at the beginning of a video or still image in the timeline. Unlike all of the 
  other chapter points, you cannot move this initial chapter point.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When transcoded to MPEG-2, the video footage is divided 
  into contiguous Groups of Pictures (GOPs), which are typically 13 frames long. 
  Playback of any frames within the GOP must begin from the start of the GOP, 
  or the GOP header. For this reason, when you insert a chapter point, Adobe Encore 
  DVD places it at the closer prior GOP header. You can view the GOP headers in 
  the Timeline window.</p>
<p>When working with AVI files, these restrictions do not apply because the file 
  has not been transcoded. When Adobe Encore DVD transcodes AVI files, it automatically 
  creates GOP headers at every chapter point you set. After transcoding, the file 
  is then considered an MPEG-2 file, and the rules for chapter point placement 
  for MPEG-2 files now apply to that clip.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To ensure both DVD-compliance and best quality transcoding, 
  place chapter points in AVI videos at least 15 frames apart.</p>
<p>To add a chapter point, Right-click the ruler in the Timeline window at the 
  spot where you want to add a chapter point, and choose Add Chapter Point. Or 
  click the <strong>Add Chapter</strong> button. Or choose Timeline &gt; Add Chapter 
  Point.</p>
<p><em>If you are working with MPEG-2 video, you have to put chapter on the GOP 
  header. To view the GOP headers in the Timeline window, zoom in on the Timeline 
  window ruler. The GOP headers are represented as white vertical lines along 
  the bottom edge of the ruler. Click either the Skip Forward button or the Skip 
  Backward button to move to the next GOP header.</em></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can change the name and description of the selected 
  chapter point in its properties window.</p>
<p> <u><strong>Working with subtitles </strong></u></p>
<p>Although you can have up to 32 subtitle tracks, a DVD player can play only 
  one subtitle track at a time. You can either import precreated subtitle files 
  or type subtitles directly into the project. Unlike audio files, the subtitles 
  cannot be imported as a single file on the track. Instead, each screen of subtitles 
  appears as a separate clip in the timeline, including subtitles you type in 
  Adobe Encore DVD. </p>
<p>When the project is built, subtitles are not incorporated into the video stream. 
  Each track becomes a separate, full-screen overlay, making it possible to display 
  any one of the 32 tracks over the same video. Subtitles are subpictures and 
  have the same restrictions as button subpictures. The subtitle overlay becomes 
  a 2-bit, 4-color image using indexed colors. In Adobe Encore DVD, one of the 
  four colors is assumed to be fully transparent (serving as the transparent background 
  of the full-screen overlay). Thus, the subtitles, like button subpictures, are 
  limited to three colors. The colors map to the outline, the fill, and partial 
  anti-aliasing of the characters. Each of the three indexed colors also includes 
  an opacity setting. </p>
<p>Adobe Encore DVD includes a predefined color set for subtitles. You can modify 
  this default set or create your own sets. Once defined, you can save color sets 
  and use them in other projects. A timeline color set consists of a maximum of 
  nine colors, each with its own opacity setting. Choose <strong>Edit &gt; Color 
  Set &gt; Timeline</strong>. ...</p>
<p> To add subtitle files to a timeline - either import from files (text script 
  files, Captions Inc. format files, and FAB format files) or type in. See more 
  on this in Adobe Help.</p>
<p>Editing assets in the timeline:</p>
<p><strong><u>Trimming and deleting video and audio clips:</u></strong></p>
<p>You can trim video and audio clips directly in the timeline, as well as in 
  the Properties palette. Open the timeline containing the video or audio clip 
  you want to trim (or click its tab in the Timeline window if it is already open). 
  Click the selection tool, and position the pointer over the end of the clip 
  that you want to trim. The pointer changes to a red bracket with a double-sided 
  arrow. Now <strong>drag the end of the clip</strong> to the desired time marker 
  to increase or decrease its length. Adobe Encore DVD changes the Out point of 
  the clip. You can use the current-time indicator to first locate the desired 
  final frame and drag the clip to it.</p>
<p>To delete a clip, just select it in the timeline, and choose <strong>Edit &gt; 
  Clear</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><u>Editing still images:</u></strong></p>
<p>You can place <strong>multiple still images</strong>, or stills, in the timeline. 
  They will <strong>group to the right</strong>. Default <strong>duration is 6 
  seconds</strong>.</p>
<p>To change the default duration - choose Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Timelines, 
  double-click the value for Default Still Length.</p>
<p>To change the duration of the still image, position the pointer over the end 
  of the still image (pointer will change into a red bracket) and drag it. Note: 
  To increase the length of a still image, there must be empty frames adjacent 
  to it.</p>
<p>Unlike insertions, <strong>deletions</strong> do not ripple through adjacent 
  items. Instead, images adjacent to the deleted image remain in position and 
  <strong>black frames replace the deleted item</strong>.</p>
<p> To move a still image, just drag it to the desired location in the timeline.</p>
<p>You can also select, copy, and paste a still image in the timeline.</p>
<p> <u><strong>Previewing the timeline in the Monitor window:</strong></u></p>
<p>You can preview the timeline in the Monitor window - just press the Play-button. 
  The Monitor window displays the contents of the currently active timeline. </p>
<p>If you want to preview your entire project by simulating DVD playback, in order 
  to check your links, use the Project Preview window. You can quickly jump to 
  the frames at chapter points and I-frames by using the Monitor window buttons. 
  Click the Prev Chapter button or Next Chapter button to move backwards / forward 
  through the chapter points.</p>

<p> Setting disc navigation and properties, menu display time and looping, menu 
  navigation and properties, button navigation and properties, timeline navigation, 
  navigation to select audio and subtitle tracks, using the Project window to 
  manage links. 
<p>You can set links and defaults for the disc or project itself, as well as for 
  each menu, button, and timeline. These links determine what happens after the 
  following events:</p>
<p>- The viewer inserts the DVD into the player (called first play). <br>
  - The viewer activates a button on a menu (called link). <br>
  - A timeline finishes playing (called end action). <br>
  - The viewer doesn't make a menu selection (called end action).<br>
  - The viewer pushes the title or menu buttons on the remote control (called 
  title button or menu remote, respectively). <br>
  - In addition, each link has an optional setting called override, which specifies 
  a new end action for the link. (See Understanding end action overrides.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Understanding end actions:</em></strong></p>
<p>End actions are navigation settings used when a timeline finishes or when you 
  have specified a duration for a menu and the viewer does not activate a button 
  within that time. End actions specify a destination to display next, either 
  a menu (including the button to highlight) or a timeline (including the chapter 
  from which to begin). If a DVD contains video clips that can be viewed individually 
  or in succession (such as outtakes or topics in an educational DVD), you might 
  choose to have the end action of each clip take the viewer to the next clip, 
  or instead you could have the end action lead back to the menu from which the 
  viewer accessed the clip. </p>
<p>End actions for menus are optional. You use them when you want to control the 
  display if a viewer does not activate a button on the menu. Menu end actions 
  are useful in DVDs that remain playing in a public place or educational setting. 
  If a viewer leaves, for example, the menu can jump back to the main menu after 
  a reasonable wait period, to be ready for the next person. </p>
<p><strong><em>Understanding end action overrides:</em></strong></p>
<p>Each standard link has an optional <strong>override</strong> setting which 
  can override the end action of that link. The standard link sets the next destination; 
  the override sets the end action of that destination, replacing its default 
  end action. <em>This option gives you dynamic control over the navigation through 
  a DVD. You can change the path through the DVD according to what the viewer 
  has just watched.</em> </p>
<p>For example, to create a music DVD, you would put the video for each song on 
  its own timeline. The end action of each video clip would point to the next 
  clip so that the viewer could play the entire disc if desired. When creating 
  the menu, you simply link the Play All button to the first video, and each clip 
  would automatically lead to the next. However, the viewer will also want play 
  to the clips individually. After playing a single video, you want the DVD to 
  return to the menu rather than moving on to the next clip. To do this, you create 
  separate buttons for each clip. Then you link each button to the individual 
  video and set the override to display the menu, thus replacing the clip's default 
  end action. </p>
<p> <em><strong>Specifying links:</strong></em></p>
<p>You specify links in the <em><strong>Properties palette</strong></em>. The 
  Properties palette changes view depending on what is selected, displaying disc, 
  menu, button, and timeline properties as appropriate. When you use the Properties 
  palette in conjunction with the Project window, you can quickly set links and 
  defaults for an entire project. </p>
<p>All links in Adobe Encore DVD point to either a menu or a timeline: </p>
<p><strong><em>Menu and button:</em></strong></p>
<p>When linking to a menu, you must also designate the button to be highlighted 
  (selected) when the menu appears. Each menu has a <strong>default button</strong> 
  that is highlighted for the viewer. You can choose to leave the default button 
  highlighted or you can designate a specific button. The button you specify replaces 
  the default setting only for that viewing of the menu. </p>
<p>Controlling which button is highlighted improves the usability of your DVD. 
  It lets you control the menu depending on where the viewer has just been. You 
  generally highlight the button that the viewer just activated, which helps the 
  viewer keep track of what clip has just played. For example, a video's end action 
  can point back to the menu and its own button. <em>After the viewer watches 
  the video, the end action leads to the menu, highlighting the video's button, 
  not the default button.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Timeline and chapter:</em></strong></p>
<p>When linking to a timeline, you also choose one of its chapter points.The link 
  specifies not just the timeline to play, but also a specific start point in 
  the timeline.</p>
<p><strong><em>Setting disc navigation and properties:</em></strong></p>
<p>When you select the <strong>Disc</strong> tab, the <strong>Properties</strong> 
  palette displays settings for the DVD. You can set the menu or timeline that 
  should display when the DVD starts, the link for the Title button on a remote 
  control, and the default audio and subtitle tracks. You can also name the disc 
  and write descriptive notes. </p>
<p><strong><em>Setting disc navigation links:</em></strong></p>
<p>(what menu or timeline to display when the DVD starts and, optionally, what 
  to display when that menu or timeline ends). </p>
<p>Click the <strong>Disc</strong> tab to activate it. <strong><br>
  <font size="-2">Note</font></strong><font size="-2">: If you plan to use the 
  <strong>pick whip</strong> to select a link, you can instead click the Timelines 
  or Menus tab in the Project window. The tab you choose depends on whether the 
  link is to be to a timeline or to a menu. Then click anywhere in the blank space 
  below the list of assets so that Adobe Encore DVD deselects any selected elements 
  and displays the disc properties in the Properties palette.) </font></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Properties</strong> tab to activate it (or choose Window 
  &gt; Properties). In the Properties palette, select a destination for <strong>First 
  Play</strong> by using one of the following methods. Adobe Encore DVD displays 
  the new link in the Properties palette using the format <strong>Menu:Button 
  or Timeline:Chapter</strong>.</p>
<p> Choose a menu or timeline from the First Play pop-up menu, and then choose 
  the button or chapter point from the submenu that appears. (Choosing Default 
  for a button leaves the default button highlighted on the destination menu.) 
</p>
<p> <strong>Note</strong>: The <strong>First Play</strong> pop-up menu lists up 
  to 20 of the most recently used menus and timelines. If the menu or timeline 
  you want is not listed, choose <strong>Specify Other</strong> from the pop-up 
  menu, as described below.</p>
<p>Choose <strong>Specify Other</strong> from the <strong>First Play</strong> 
  pop-up menu. Then open the desired folder, and select the button or chapter 
  point. (To leave the default button unchanged, select the <em>menu name rather 
  than a button</em>.) Click OK.</p>
<p> Drag the <strong>First Play</strong> <strong>pick whip</strong> to the destination 
  menu or timeline in the Project tab; or to the chapter point in the timeline 
  or Timelines tab; or to the menu or button in the Menus tab. If you drag to 
  a menu or timeline, rather than to a button or chapter point, Adobe Encore DVD 
  <u>sets the button to Default or the chapter to Chapter 1.</u> If you want to 
  change the end action for the First Play link, select a destination for Override 
  in the Properties palette.</p>
<p> <em><strong>The disc-related link options in the Properties palette are as 
  follows:</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>First Play</em></strong> - Specifies which menu or timeline is 
  displayed when the viewer first starts the DVD, as well as which button is highlighted 
  or at which chapter point to begin in the timeline. For menus, unless you select 
  Default from the list of buttons, the button you choose overrides the linked 
  menu's default button. Adobe Encore DVD initially sets First Play to the first 
  menu or timeline created in the project, or to the first menu imported. </p>
<p><strong><em>Override</em></strong> - (Optional) Sets the end action for the 
  link specified in First Play. This link overrides the default end action of 
  the menu or timeline. You can specify a menu and the button to highlight or 
  a timeline and starting chapter point.</p>
<p><strong><em>Setting the link for the Title button of a remote control:</em></strong></p>
<p>DVD remote controls have a Title button. You generally set this button to return 
  the viewer to the beginning of the DVD, which is either the link specified for 
  First Play or the main menu of the DVD. Therefore, at any point in the DVD, 
  the viewer can exit the current feature or menu and start over. As with other 
  links, you specify a menu and the button to highlight, or a timeline and starting 
  chapter point. </p>
<p>Note: Do not confuse the Title button with the Menu button. The Menu button 
  is a more local setting, rather than a DVD-wide setting. The Menu button should 
  take you back to the menu for the current feature, whereas the Title button 
  should return you to the main menu for the DVD. You specify a link for the Menu 
  button in each timeline. (See Setting timeline navigation.)</p>
<p>To set the link for the Title button of a remote control - click the Disc tab 
  to activate it. <br>
  <font size="-2">Note: If you plan to use the <strong>pick whip</strong> to select 
  the link, you can instead click the Timeline or Menus tab in the Project window. 
  The tab you choose depends on whether the link is to be to a timeline or menu. 
  Then click anywhere in the blank space below the list of assets so that Adobe 
  Encore DVD deselects any selected elements and displays the disc properties 
  in the Properties palette.) </font></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Properties</strong> tab to activate it (or choose <strong>Window 
  &gt; Properties</strong>). In the Properties palette, select a destination for 
  <strong>Title Button</strong> by using one of the following methods. Adobe Encore 
  DVD displays the new link in the Properties palette using the format <strong>Menu:Button</strong> 
  or <strong>Timeline:Chapter</strong>. Choose a menu or timeline from the <strong>Title 
  Button pop-up menu</strong>, and then choose the button or chapter point from 
  the submenu that appears. (Choosing Default for a button leaves the default 
  button highlighted on the destination menu.) <br>
  <strong><font size="-2">Note</font></strong><font size="-2">: The Title Button 
  pop-up menu lists up to 20 of the most recently used menus and timelines. If 
  the menu or timeline you want is not listed, choose <strong>Specify Other</strong> 
  from the pop-up menu, as described below.</font></p>
<p>Choose <strong>Specify Other</strong> from the <strong>Title Button pop-up 
  menu</strong>. Then open the desired folder, and select the button or chapter 
  point. (To leave the default button unchanged, select the menu name rather than 
  a button.) Click OK. Drag the <strong>Title Button pick whip</strong> to the 
  destination menu or timeline in the <strong>Project</strong> tab; or to the 
  chapter point in the <strong>timeline</strong> or <strong>Timelines tab</strong>; 
  or to the menu or button in the <strong>Menus tab</strong>. If you drag to a 
  menu or timeline, rather than to a button or chapter point, Adobe Encore DVD 
  sets the button to Default or the chapter to Chapter1.</p>
<p><strong><em>Understanding menu display time and looping:</em></strong></p>
<p>The default display setting for a menu is <strong>Hold Forever</strong>, which 
  displays the menu indefinitely. You can limit how long a menu waits for the 
  viewer to activate a button, and you can designate what should display next 
  if the viewer makes no selection. Controlling the display time of a menu is 
  usually necessary in DVDs left running to be viewed by many people, such as 
  in information kiosks, museum displays, or educational settings. When one viewer 
  leaves, it is important that the DVD returns to the main menu so that it is 
  ready for the next viewer. </p>
<p>The four settings control the duration and looping of a menu: <strong>Hold 
  Forever</strong>, <strong>Duration</strong>, <strong>Loop #</strong>, and <strong>Loop 
  Point</strong>. When selected, Hold Forever sets the menu to display indefinitely 
  until the viewer activates a button. Duration, Loop #, and Loop Point control 
  the display time and repetition of the menu.</p>
<p><strong><em>Understanding Duration:</em></strong></p>
<p>For a still menu, you can set the display time to a specific amount (called 
  <strong>Duration</strong>). For motion menus, the Duration setting determines 
  how long the menu plays before either repeating itself (called <strong>Loop 
  #</strong>) or triggering the <strong>end action</strong>. So for motion menus, 
  the total display time is the <strong>Duration multiplied by the Loop #</strong>. 
  The video or audio content of the menu play within the confines of the Duration. 
  You generally set the menu duration to match the length of the background. If 
  the run time of the video or audio content exceeds the menu duration, <strong>it 
  is clipped</strong>. If the run time of the video background or audio is less 
  than the duration, <strong>it ends</strong>. (The background displays the last 
  frame until the menu loops or ends). On the other hand, if the run time of a 
  video thumbnail button is less than the duration, it repeats until the menu 
  loops or ends. </p>
<p> <em><strong>Understanding Loop# and Loop Point:</strong></em></p>
<p>If the menu is set to loop (<strong>Loop #</strong> contains a value other 
  than <strong>None</strong>), all content begins again. The only exception to 
  this is when you specify a <strong>Loop Point</strong>. To loop a motion menu 
  until the viewer activates a button, you can set <strong>Loop #</strong> to 
  <strong>Forever</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Loop Point</strong> designates at what point within the display 
  time of the menu the viewer can select or activate a button. Prior to this point, 
  the buttons are inactive. If the <strong>Loop #</strong> is set to a value other 
  than None, the menu returns to this point on each repetition. Thus, for any 
  subsequent repetitions, the <strong>Loop Point reduces the menu Duration</strong> 
  and <strong>offsets the start point of all video content in the menu</strong>. 
</p>
<p><strong><em>Setting menu navigation and properties:</em></strong></p>
<p>Buttons on a menu control the links for the standard navigation of your DVD. 
  You can, however, link the menu to another destination if the viewer does not 
  activate a button in a <em>set length of time (still menu)</em> or <em>after 
  the menu has looped a specified number of times (motion menu)</em>. The menu 
  properties also include a setting that controls which button is highlighted 
  each time the menu is displayed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Setting menu display time and end action navigation:</em></strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Properties</strong> palette contains several options that control 
  the display time and looping of a menu. You can let the menu display indefinitely 
  or limit how long a menu waits for the viewer to activate a button. If the viewer 
  makes no selection, you can designate what should display next. If the menu 
  contains video or audio content, you can set the menu to loop a specific number 
  of times. In addition, you can initially disable the menu buttons until the 
  menu has displayed a set amount of time (the Loop Point), and on subsequent 
  repetitions of the menu it will loop back to that point.</p>
<p>To set the display time of a menu:<br>
  - Click the Project tab to activate it.<br>
  - Select the desired menu from the list of assets.<br>
  - Click the Properties tab to activate it (or choose Window &gt; Properties). 
  <br>
  <br>
  - (<em><strong>Still menus only</strong></em>) To set the display time, do one 
  of the following actions in the Properties palette:<br>
  -- To have the menu display until the viewer selects an option, select <strong>Hold 
  Forever</strong>. (<strong><font size="-2">&nbsp;Note</font></strong><font size="-2">: 
  When you select Hold Forever, Adobe Encore DVD leaves the values for End Action, 
  Override, and Duration unchanged, but does not use them. ) </font> To set the 
  menu display time to a fixed amount, click <strong>Hold Forever</strong> to 
  deselect it and then double-click the value for <strong>Duration</strong>. Enter 
  the amount of time you want the menu to display, using the format <strong>mm:ss</strong> 
  (minutes:seconds). <br>
  <br>
  - (<em><strong>Motion menus only</strong></em>) To set the display time and 
  looping, do one or more of the following actions in the Properties palette:<br>
  To set the menu display time to a fixed amount, click <strong>Hold Forever</strong> 
  to deselect it and then double-click the value for <strong>Duration</strong>. 
  Enter the amount of time you want the menu to display, using the format mm:ss 
  (minutes:seconds). Make sure <strong>Hold Forever</strong> is not selected.<br>
  To have the menu loop a set number of times, select or type a value for <strong>Loop 
  #</strong>.<br>
  To have a menu loop until the viewer activates a button, select <strong>Forever</strong> 
  from the <strong>Loop # pop-up menu</strong>.<br>
  To disable the menu buttons for a set amount of time, type a timecode value 
  for <strong>Loop Point</strong>.<br>
  If you set the menu to display for a set amount of time or to loop a limited 
  number of times, set the end action for the menu so that it has a destination 
  once it times out. </p>
<p> <em><strong>To set the End Action and Override links for a menu:</strong></em></p>
<p>Click the Project tab to activate it, select the desired menu from the list 
  of assets, click the Properties tab to activate it (or choose Window &gt; Properties). 
  <br>
  If you want the menu to lead to another menu or timeline when it times out, 
  select a destination for End Action in the Properties palette using one of the 
  following methods. Adobe Encore DVD displays the new link in the Properties 
  palette using the format <strong>Menu:Button</strong> or <strong>Timeline:Chapter</strong>.<br>
  Choose a menu or timeline from the <strong>End Action</strong> pop-up menu, 
  and then choose the button or chapter point from the submenu that appears. (Choosing 
  Default for a button leaves the default button highlighted on the destination 
  menu.) <br>
  <strong><font size="-2">Note</font></strong><font size="-2">: The <strong>End 
  Action</strong> submenu lists up to 20 of the most recently used menus and timelines. 
  If the menu or timeline you want is not listed, choose <strong>Specify Other</strong> 
  from the pop-up menu, as described below.</font></p>
<p>Choose <strong>Specify Other</strong> from the <strong>End Action</strong> 
  pop-up menu. Then open the desired folder, and select the button or chapter 
  point. (To keep the default button unchanged, select the menu name rather than 
  a button.) Click OK. Drag the <strong>End Action pick whip</strong> to the desired 
  menu or timeline in the <strong>Project tab</strong>; or to the chapter point 
  in the <strong>timeline</strong> or <strong>Timelines tab</strong>; or to the 
  menu or button in the <strong>Menus tab</strong>. If you drag to a menu or timeline, 
  rather than a button or chapter point, Adobe Encore DVD sets the button to Default 
  or the chapter to Chapter1.</p>
<p> If you want to change the end action for the destination link, <strong>select 
  a destination for Override in the Properties palette</strong>. The <strong>Properties 
  palette</strong> contains the following menu navigation options:<br>
  - <strong>End Action</strong> - (Optional) Sets the menu or timeline to switch 
  to when the menu has timed out. Default setting is <strong><em>None</em></strong>.<br>
  - <strong>Override</strong> - (Optional) Specifies a link that should override 
  the end action of the menu or timeline to which this menu is linked. Default 
  setting is <strong>Not Set</strong>, which leaves the end action unchanged.</p>
<p><strong><em>Setting the default button on a menu:</em></strong></p>
<p>Each time a menu displays, one button can be automatically highlighted (selected) 
  for the viewer. You specify this default button in the <strong>Properties palette</strong>. 
  When a link leads to a menu, it may designate that a different button be highlighted. 
  This link setting replaces the default button only for that viewing of the menu.</p>
<p>To specify the default button of a menu: Click the Project tab to activate 
  it, select the desired menu from the list of assets, click the Properties tab 
  to activate it (or choose Window &gt; Properties). In the Properties palette, 
  select the number of the button that you want to be highlighted from the <strong>Default 
  Button pop-up menu</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Animating video thumbnail buttons:</em></strong></p>
<p>You can set video thumbnail buttons to be either still or moving using the 
  <strong>menu property</strong> <strong>Animate Buttons</strong>. When you select 
  the menu property, you convert all the video <em>thumbnail buttons</em> on the 
  menu to <em>motion buttons</em>. Thus, each time the viewer displays the menu, 
  the video links play in the thumbnails. When <strong>Animate Buttons</strong> 
  is deselected, the thumbnails display a still frame of the video. You can specify 
  <em>which frame</em> to display using the <em>Poster option</em> in the <strong>Chapter 
  mode</strong> of the <strong>Properties palette</strong>. The <strong>Animate 
  Button</strong> property controls the state of <em><strong>all</strong></em> 
  the video thumbnail buttons on the menu. <em>You cannot set them individually.</em> 
  Adobe Encore DVD composites the video into the button during the build process.</p>
<p><strong>To activate video thumbnail buttons</strong> - click the Project tab 
  to activate it, In the Project tab, select the menu containing the video thumbnail 
  buttons, Click the Properties tab to activate it (or choose Window &gt; Properties), 
  In the Properties palette, select Animate Buttons.</p>
<p><strong><em>Setting button navigation and properties:</em></strong></p>
<p>Each button in a menu must lead to another menu or to a chapter point in a 
  timeline. You set the navigational links of a button and the optional end action 
  override of that link in the Button mode of the Properties palette.</p>
<p>If the button layer set includes a thumbnail layer (a layer with the prefix 
  (%)) - the button link serves as both the destination of the button and its 
  contents.</p>

<p><strong><em>Setting a button to auto activate:</em></strong></p>
<p>Normally, activating a button requires that the viewer first select it with 
  the navigation buttons on the remote control (or by mousing over it), and then 
  press Enter. You can set a button to activate automatically when the viewer 
  simply selects it with the remote control (or mouse). The Auto Activate option 
  is often used for arrow buttons and for creating hidden navigation (called Easter 
  eggs). An advanced authoring technique uses multiple versions of a menu that 
  change when the viewer selects certain buttons. Instead of using subpictures 
  to highlight a button, the buttons auto activate when selected and link to another 
  version of the menu. </p>
<p>To set a button to auto activate simply select it - and turn on <strong>Auto 
  Activate</strong> option in Properties.</p>
<p><strong><em>Updating subpicture text automatically:</em></strong></p>
<p>Using the <strong>Create Text Subpicture</strong> command, you can automatically 
  create a text subpicture layer (or update text in an existing subpicture layer). 
  If the subpicture layer already exists, it must be in the layer with the (=1) 
  prefix. No other elements should be in the layer. When you edit the button text, 
  Adobe Encore DVD duplicates the text (turning off anti-aliasing) and creates 
  a new (=1) layer. The previous (=1) layer is replaced.</p>

<p>Click the <strong>Menus tab</strong> to activate it. In the <strong>Menus tab</strong>, 
  select the menus containing the <em>buttons with subpicture text</em>. In the 
  lower panel, select all the buttons that you want updated automatically. Click 
  the <strong>Properties tab</strong> to activate it (or choose Window &gt; Properties). 
  In the Properties palette, select <strong>Create Text Subpicture</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Setting timeline navigation:</em></strong></p>
<p>The Timeline mode of the Properties palette lets you set which menu or timeline 
  to link to <strong>when the timeline finishes playing</strong> and <strong>when 
  the viewer selects the Menu button on the remote control</strong>. </p>
<p>Most DVD remote controls have a Menu button. You generally set this button 
  to return the viewer to <strong>the last menu accessed</strong>, that is, the 
  menu that brought the viewer to this timeline. As with other links, you specify 
  a menu and the button to highlight, or a timeline and starting chapter point. 
</p>
<p><font size="-2"><strong>Note</strong>: Do not confuse the <strong>Menu button</strong> 
  with the <strong>Title button</strong>. The Menu button is a timeline setting; 
  the Title button is a DVD-wide setting. The Title button returns you to the 
  main menu of the DVD from any point in the program. You specify a link for the 
  Title button in the Disc mode of the Properties palette. (See Setting disc navigation 
  and properties.)</font></p>
<p><strong><em>To set timeline navigation and the Menu Remote:</em></strong></p>
<p>Click the Project tab to activate it. In the Project tab, select the desired 
  timeline in the list of assets. Click the Properties tab to activate it (or 
  choose Window &gt; Properties). In the Properties palette, select a <strong>destination 
  for End Action</strong> by using one of the following methods. Adobe Encore 
  DVD displays the new link in the Properties palette using the format <strong>Menu:Button</strong> 
  or <strong>Timeline:Chapter</strong>. <br>
  - Choose a menu or timeline from the <strong>End Action pop-up menu</strong>, 
  and then choose the button or chapter point from the submenu that appears. (Choosing 
  Default for a button leaves the default button highlighted on the destination 
  menu.) <font size="-2">Note: The End Action pop-up menus lists up to 20 of the 
  most recently used menus and timelines. If the menu or timeline you want is 
  not listed, choose Specify Other from the pop-up menu, as described below. <br>
  </font>- Choose <strong>Specify Other</strong> from the <strong>End Action pop-up 
  menu</strong>. Then open the desired folder, and select the <strong>button</strong> 
  or <strong>chapter point</strong>. (To select the default button, select the 
  menu name rather than a button.) Click OK. Drag the <strong>End Action pick 
  whip</strong> to the desired menu or timeline in the Project tab; or to the 
  chapter point in the timeline or Timelines tab; or to the menu or button in 
  the Menus tab. If you drag to a menu or timeline, rather than a button or chapter 
  point, Adobe Encore DVD sets the button to Default or the chapter to Chapter1. 
  If you want to change the end action for the destination link, select a destination 
  for Override.<br>
  Select a destination for Menu Remote.<br>
  The Timeline mode of the Properties palette contains the following navigation 
  options:<br>
  - <strong>End Action</strong> - Specifies the menu or timeline to switch to 
  when the timeline has finished, as well as which button is highlighted or at 
  which chapter point to begin in the timeline.<br>
  - <strong>Override</strong> - (Optional) Specifies a link that should override 
  the end action of the menu or timeline to which this timeline is linked. Default 
  setting is Not Set, which leaves the end action unchanged. (See Understanding 
  end action overrides.)<br>
  - <strong>Menu Remote</strong> - Specifies the destination to switch to when 
  the viewer pushes the Menu button on the remote control. You usually set this 
  button to return the viewer to the last menu accessed. </p>
<strong><em>Setting navigation to select audio and subtitle tracks: </em></strong> 
<p>When a DVD includes audio and/or subtitle tracks, it is important to set the 
  default tracks for the disc and to give the viewer a way to select the tracks. 
  ... (see Adobe Help)</p>
<p> <em><strong>Using the Project window to manage links:</strong></em></p>
<p>The Project window is an excellent planning and management tool for a project. 
  It gives you an overview of a project and all its elements. It is divided into 
  four tabs: <strong>Project, Menus, Timelines, and Disc</strong>. The Menus tab, 
  for example, lets you view all the menus, the buttons of the selected menus, 
  and their links, while the Timelines tab lists the timelines and the chapter 
  points of the selected timelines. The Disc tab also lets you locate missing 
  or unassigned links.</p>
<p> <em><strong>Changing multiple links and properties:</strong></em></p>
<p>You use the Project window and the Properties palette together to manage links. 
  You cannot edit any fields directly in the Project window. You can, however, 
  select an element (such as a button) in the Project window and change its properties 
  in the Properties palette. But even more powerful is the ease with which you 
  can make global changes to menus, buttons, or timelines using these two tools 
  together. </p>
<p>For example, suppose the end action for several timelines points to the Main 
  menu, and you now prefer these timelines to point to the Events menu. In the 
  Timelines tab, you can <font color="#FF0000">select several timelines you want 
  to change, and then reassign the end action to Events in the Properties palette 
  (for all selected timelines at once !!!)</font>.</p>
<p> <em><strong>Finding missing links and unassigned assets:</strong></em></p>
<p>Before you build your project, it is always a good idea to first check for 
  missing or unassigned links. Through the development of a DVD, it is easy to 
  forget that you deleted a button from a menu or replaced one video clip with 
  another. The <strong>Check Links option</strong> can help you quickly find problem 
  links as well as menus and timelines that you created, but did not use (called 
  orphans).</p>
<p><strong><em>To check the links and assets of a project:</em></strong></p>
<p>Choose <strong>Edit &gt; Check Links</strong> or click the <strong>Disc tab</strong> 
  to activate it and then click the <strong>Check Links button</strong>.<br>
  In the Check Links dialog box, select one or more of the following search options, 
  and click Start. <br>
  Adobe Encore DVD lists the items that match any one of the search criteria:<br>
  - <strong>Broken Links</strong> searches for links that point to missing menus, 
  buttons, or timelines. <br>
  - <strong>Links Not Set</strong> searches for links with nothing specified. 
  <br>
  - <strong>Orphan Menus</strong> searches for menus that are not used in the 
  project.<br>
  - <strong>Orphan Timelines</strong> searches for timelines that are not used 
  in the project. <br>
  <font size="-2"><strong>Note</strong>: Because nothing links to orphaned items, 
  the viewer is not able to access them via normal navigation of a DVD. However, 
  using the title search feature available on some DVD players, a viewer can search 
  for all video content and thus access an orphaned timeline. In addition, the 
  orphaned items take up valuable space on the DVD, potentially reducing the quality 
  of the other content when you build the project. Therefore, it is best to clean 
  up orphaned assets unless you want them viewed.</font></p>
<p>To correct a broken link or a link not set, select the menu, button, or timeline<strong> 
  in the Check Links dialog box</strong>. Then, click the Properties tab to activate 
  it, and correct the link options in the Properties palette. To include an orphaned 
  menu or timeline in the project, determine the appropriate item that should 
  link to the orphan. Select that item in the Check Links dialog box or the Project 
  window, and set its link to the orphan in the Properties palette. Repeat until 
  you have corrected all the problem links. Then click the close box in the upper 
  right corner of the dialog box or click Done.</p>

<p>Working in the Project Preview window
<p>In addition to the actual preview, the Project Preview window displays controls 
  for navigation and transport, zoom, audio and subtitle cycles, and the other 
  preview functions. The navigation (menu-related) and transport (timeline-related) 
  controls duplicate the appearance and functionality of the standard controls 
  found on remote controls and consoles for television DVD players as well as 
  those found in the playback windows of computer-based DVD players. The behavior 
  of the transport controls can be customized if necessary.
<p> To preview a project, choose <strong>File &gt; Preview</strong> to open the 
  Project Preview window. Click a menu, transport control, or navigation button 
  to test your project navigation and playback. Note, that projects without First 
  Play actions will not preview. 
<p> Previewing motion menus, .. , File &gt; Render Motion Menus, File &gt; Preview, 
  navigate to the desired menu and then click the Menu Status button, File &gt; 
  Preview, ...</p>
<p> You can monitor the status of your preview in the status area of the Project 
  Preview window below the playback area.</p> </p>
<p>To exit the preview, you can jsut close the window, or press &quot;Exit And 
  Return&quot; or &quot;Exit here&quot; button.</p>
<p>By default, the Project Preview window uses a 4:3 aspect ratio (can be changed: 
  choose <strong>Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Preview</strong>).</p>
<p>Note: Full-screen playback is not available. That is, the Project Preview window 
  cannot be resized to occupy the entire computer monitor.</p>
<p><strong><u>Understanding copy protection:</u></strong></p>
<p>Copy protection is turned off by default for each new project. If copy protection 
  is required, you must replicate using a digital linear tape (DLT). You can specify 
  copy-protection settings for subsequent projects (Choose Edit &gt; Preferences 
  &gt; Mastering). You can alter copy-protection settings for the current project 
  via the Disc tab in the Project window. Copy protection only works on replicated 
  discs. Adobe Encore DVD employs three types of copy protection: Content Scrambling 
  System (CSS - encryption), Macrovision (also called the Analog Protection System 
  - sends electronic pulses to the analog device to disrupt recording sync), and 
  CGMS (restircts number of copies to be made). Read more in Adobe Help</p>
<p> <u><strong>Understanding region coding:</strong></u></p>
<p>The DVD player only plays back a DVD if the player recognizes the region code. 
  You can allow all regions to play your DVD, or only a select number of them 
  (Click the Disc tab, and then click the Project Settings button to open the 
  Project Settings dialog box). Region coding only works on replicated discs. 
  Projects written directly to DVD-R will have all regions enabled.</p>
<p> <u><strong>Building the finished project:</strong></u></p>
<p>Once you have completed, successfully previewed, and set transcoding options 
  for your project, you are ready to build it into a DVD-compliant file ready 
  for burning or replication. Before building your project though, you should 
  verify your project settings, especially the disc parameters (size, number of 
  layers and sides), region coding and copy-protection settings.</p>
<p>Adobe Encore DVD verifies and prompts if not all the links in the project have 
  valid destinations. If you decide to change the links, you must interrupt the 
  build process and change your links in the overview.</p>
<p>You have 4 options:<br>
  <u><em><strong>Make DVD Disc</strong></em></u> - builds a disc to play on television 
  DVD players, computers, or game consoles. You can record to a DVD in a DVD-writable 
  drive or to a CD in a CD-R or CD-RW drive. If you intend to write to a CD, keep 
  in mind that it will play only in computer-based DVD-compatible drives. Also, 
  you are constrained by the data capacity of a CD-ROM, which is usually 650 to 
  700 MB, significantly less than that of a DVD. Still, writing DVD-compliant 
  files to a CD-ROM is a good way to distribute very short projects not intended 
  for television viewing. The quality will equal that of a DVD disc.</p>
<p><strong><em><u>Make DVD Folder</u></em></strong> - builds a DVD directory structure 
  on your hard drive for quality assurance or local playback on a PC. You can 
  play the program using a DVD playback device and the directory behaves just 
  like a disc, including having full navigational abilities.</p>
<p><strong><u><em>Make DVD Image</em></u></strong> - builds a DVD image on your 
  hard drive. The DVD image is typically used for local replication using a third-party 
  mastering application. </p>
<p><strong><u><em>Make DVD Master</em></u></strong> - writes to a digital linear 
  tape (DLT) used for mass replication of DVDs. Creating a DVD master requires 
  having a Digital Linear Tape (DLT) drive connected to your computer.</p>
<p><strong><u><em>To build a DVD</em></u></strong> - make sure that you have blank 
  media in the appropriate drive. Choose <strong>File &gt; Build</strong> and 
  choose the option corresponding to the type of file you want to build. Save 
  the project when prompted. If you have any broken links in your project, you 
  are prompted to manage them or ignore them. It is recommended that you fix all 
  broken links. In the Make [Build Choice] dialog box, set the appropriate options 
  and then click Next. In the Summary window, note your build parameters, and 
  click Build.</p>
<p><strong><u><em>Build Options:</em></u></strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Create Using - Specifies the project or file to burn. Current 
  Project appears by default if you are building your working project. Otherwise, 
  choose DVD Volume or Disc Image to burn a file you've already compiled on your 
  hard drive or click Browse to find the file.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Location - Specifies the destination for your build folder 
  or disc image. Type the destination file path or click Browse to specify the 
  location.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Recorder - Specifies the disc writer to which the project 
  is sent for burning. Click Search to scan your hardware for additional disc 
  writers.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Device - Specifies the DLT drive destination for the build. 
  Click Search to scan your system for any other compatible DLT devices.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Write Speed - Specifies how fast the selected disc writer 
  will write to the disc. Adobe Encore DVD displays the maximum speed of the drive 
  you selected. You may select a lower speed.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Number of Copies - If you choose to burn multiple copies, 
  Adobe Encore DVD prompts you to insert new discs when it is time to burn new 
  copies.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Test before writing - Specifies whether Adobe Encore DVD 
  tests the process before burning the disc. If there are any problems, Adobe 
  Encore DVD displays a dialog box explaining what happened and the burn is cancelled. 
  If no problems are detected, writing continues automatically.</p>
<p><strong><u><em>Replicating DVDs:</em></u></strong></p>
<p>Most replication facilities can accept files in several formats, such as DLT 
  or a DVD image. Dual-layer DVDs and those that use copy protection or region 
  coding must be replicated at a professional replication facility. If you burn 
  these types of DVDs from Adobe Encore DVD, the resulting discs will work, but 
  they will not include copy protection or region coding.</p>
