These are the examples from the book:

The book and the examples were written by David Flanagan.  They

To browse the examples, load the file index.html into your
JavaScript-enabled web browser.

If you want to experiment with the examples, however, you should copy
and modify the files in this directory.  The file names correspond to
the example numbers from the book.  Different examples have different
file extensions.  Those that end with .html are HTML files; typically
these can be loaded and run directly in a web browser.  The files with a
.js extension are files of pure JavaScript code.  They cannot be loaded
directly into a browser.  A few particularly useful files of JavaScript
code are also given textual names, such as DynEl.js.

The files in the text/ directory are copies of the files in this
directory, with a .txt extension.  These duplicate copies exist so that
the HTML and JavaScript code can be displayed in a Web browser without
interpretation.  

The files in the images/ directory are images used by a few of the
examples.
