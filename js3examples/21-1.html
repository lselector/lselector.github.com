  These two buttons both have event handlers that contain JavaScript
  code, and must therefore be signed. The ID attributes specify the
  names under which the digital signatures of the code will be stored
  in the JAR file specified by a previous ARCHIVE attribute. Note that
  an ARCHIVE attribute can only be specified for a SCRIPT tag, so 
  a SCRIPT tag must appear before any event handlers appear.
