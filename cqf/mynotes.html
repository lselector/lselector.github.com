        <img src="images/martingale.jpg" width="240" height="55"><br>
      a martingale is a stochastic process (i.e., a sequence of random variables) such that the conditional expected value of an observation at some time t, given all the observations up to some earlier time s, is equal to the observation at that earlier time s. Example: Suppose <em>X</em><em>n</em> is a gambler's fortune after <em>n</em> tosses   of a coin, where the   gambler wins $1 if the coin comes up heads and loses $1 if the coin comes up   tails. The gambler's conditional expected fortune after the next trial, given   the history, is equal to his present fortune, so this sequence is a martingale.</p>

        SDE - Stochastic Differential Equation<br>
        r- interest rate, random variable (1-factor model - SDE of a random walk of r).<br>
        r is an underlying asset (like S in equities). Bond is  a derivative of r with expiring = maturity.<br>
        spot rate - yield at a very short time (in practice - 1 month),<br>
        dr = u(r,t)dt + w(r,t)dX<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Vasicek model: u = (&eta; - &gamma;r), w=&sigma;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Cox_Ingersoll_Ross model:  u = (&eta; - &gamma;r), w=&sigma;*sqrt(r)<br>
        Derivation of pricing SDE - similar to B.S., but as  r is not a traded, we can not use it to hedge while creating risk-free portfolio. The trick - hedge a bond with a bond of different maturity.<br>
      &Pi; = V<sub>1</sub> - &Delta;V<sub>2</sub>. To remove randomness: &Delta; = (dV<sub>1</sub>/dr)/(dV<sub>2</sub>/dr).<br>
      Using Ito and the above expression for &Delta;, we separate variables of V1 one one side, and V2 on the other. They should be equal regardless of which bond / maturity we use =&gt; so they shold be equal to some universal a(r,t) which represent drift:<br>
      <img src="images/int_rate1.jpg" width="337" height="97"><br>
      We write a() as:<br>
      <img src="images/int_rate2.jpg" width="359" height="39"><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;w - volatility<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;u - drift<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(u - &lambda;w) - risk neutral drift (or risk adjusted drift)<br>
dr = (u - &lambda;w)dt + wdX - risk neutral spot rate SDE<br>
        Then we get BPE (Bond Pricing Equation) (similar to BS equation for equities):<br>
        <img src="images/int_rate3.jpg" width="465" height="80"><br>
        Final Condition for a zero-coupon bond is V(r,T) = 1.<br>
        Similar to equities - the value of derivative is a risk-neutral expectation of the present value of the payoff:<br>

        Tractable models - SDE with closed-form solutino (for example, in a form Z=exp(A-rB)).<br>
        <span class="style1">Examples of models:</span><br>

        - <span class="style1">Cox, Ingersoll &amp; Ross</span> - dr = (&eta; - &gamma;r)dt + sqrt(&alpha;r)dX. Solution againin the form exp(A(t)-rB(t)<br>
        - <span class="style1">Ho &amp; Lee</span> - dr = &eta;(t)dt + sqrt(&beta;)dX, where drift is time dependent (for calibration), and volatility is constant. <br>
&nbsp;      Solution in the form: V(r,t;T) = exp(A(t)-rB(t)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression for A(t) contains integral of &eta;(t).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We can chose &eta;(t) so that output of the model will == market prices (Yield-curve fitting).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the first &quot;no-arbitrage&quot; model of the term structure of interest rates. <br>
        - <span class="style1">Hull &amp; White</span> - similar to Vasicek and CIR, but parameters are made time-dependent. This allows to fit yield curve. <br>
        - etc.<br>
        A more general model: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- drift = (&eta;(t) - &gamma;(t)r) - this is mean reversion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- w(r,t) = sqrt( &alpha;(t)r + &beta;(t) ) - we can assure that r is positive (&gt; -&beta;/&alpha;)<br>
        Solution is still in form V(r,t) = exp(A(t)-rB(t)).<br>

        V = V(r,l,t)<br>

        <p>How to deduce spot-rate model from data.<br>
        (1) find from data how volatility depends on r: w(r)<br>
        (2)  examine the steady-state PDF for the spot rate =&gt; find drift rate u(r)<br>
        (3) slope of yield curve =&gt; 
        &lambda;(r)<br>
        The volatility structure - usually in the form &nu;*r<sup>&beta;</sup><br>
        We find the &beta; which makes the best fit.<br>
        Note - It is difficult to model the &lambda;(r) due to big errors.<br>
        Forward rate vs spot rate:<br>
        <span class="style1">Forward rate curve = expected future path of the risk-adjusted spot rate.</span><br>
        - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_rate">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_rate</a> - forward rate is the future yield on a bond. It is calculated using the yield curve. For example, the yield on a three-month Treasury bill six months from now is a forward rate.<br>
        The general formula used to calculate the forward rate is:<br>
        <img src="images/forward_rate1.jpg" width="324" height="60"><br>
        Where<br>
        r<sub>1,2</sub> is the forward rate between term t<sub>1</sub> and term t<sub>2</sub>,<br>
        d<sub>1</sub> is the time length between time 0 and term t<sub>1</sub> (in years),<br>
        d<sub>2</sub> is the time length between time 0 and term t<sub>2</sub> (in years),<br>
        r<sub>1</sub> is the interest rate for the period time 0 to term t<sub>1</sub> ,<br>
        r<sub>2</sub> is the interest rate for the period time 0 to term t<sub>2</sub> ,<br>
        </p>
        <p>In order to extract the forward rate, one needs the term structure of interest rates = <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_structure_of_interest_rates">yield curve</a>. <br>

        dF(t;T) = m(t,T)dt + &nu;(t,T)dX<br>
        where m(t,T) = &nu;(t,T) * Integral<sub>t</sub><sup>T</sup> &nu;(t,s)ds<br>
        Monte-Carlo simulations:  simulate evolution of the whole curve; calculate cashflows under each evolution;  discount cashflows at the realized rate r(t) - get expected present value for this realization. Repeat the cycle.<br>
        Problems: calculations are slow. Also as the process is non-Markov, trees become &quot;bushy&quot; (forward curve after up-down movement is not the same as after down-up movement).<br>
        Musiela parametrization :  &nu;(t,T) =  &nu;<sub>m</sub>(t,T-t)<br>
        Multi-factor HJM:<br>
        dF(t;T) = m(t,T)dt + &Sigma;&nu;<sub>i</sub>(t,T)dX<sub>i</sub><br>
        Spot rat process: r(t) = F(t;t). Non-Markov nature of HJM - dependence on history (path-dependent).<br>
        Comparison of HJM model and Ho &amp; Lee:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dr =  &eta;(t)dt + cdX<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dF(t,T) = -c<sup>2</sup>(T-t)dt +cdX<br>
        Two main ways to use HJM:<br>
        1) choose volatility structure &nu;<sub>i</sub>(t,T) to be nice to make a tractable model (Markov)<br>
        2) use 'classical' popular spot-rate models.<br>
        Yet another way - to choose volatility structure to match the data.<br>
        Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - we take historical data for forward rates for several years, calculate covariances between rates of different maturities - get a 10x10 symmetric covariance matrix, find eigen vectors/values - essentially find common movements in the rates. Those eigenvectors sorted by eigenvalues starting from largest ones are called principal components. In practice ~95% of the dynamics of the F(t) can be explained by first 2 components.<br></td>

        if we start with rate to calc bonds - we get &quot;fudge function&quot;. So it may be better to start with bond dynamics first - and then deduce dynamics of interest rates (HJM class of models).<br>
        - satisfactory:<br> 
        --the forward measure, term structure of forward rates. Interpretation of Radon-Nikod'ym derivative lambda as an intemporal no-arbitrage condition is particularly intuitive and elegant.<br>
        -- As long as bonds follow geometric dynamics, the value of the derivative will be of the same form (irrespecive of the model).<br>

  <p>- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_smile">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_smile</a> - the volatility smile is a long-observed pattern in which at-the-money options tend to have lower implied volatilities than in- or out-of-the-money options. The pattern displays different characteristics for different markets and results from the probability of extreme moves. Equity options traded in American markets did not show a volatility smile before the Crash of 1987 but began showing one afterwards.</p>
  <p>Modelling the volatility smile is an active area of research in quantitative finance. Typically, a quantitative analyst will calculate the implied volatility from liquid vanilla options and use models of the smile to calculate the price of more exotic options.</p>
  <p>A closely related concept is that of term structure of volatility, which refers to how implied volatility differs for related options with different maturities. An implied volatility surface is a 3-D plot that combines volatility smile and term structure of volatility into a consolidated view of all options for an underlier.</p>

      <p>Two ways to do estimates:</p>
      <p>1. from actual historical volatility -&gt; to implied volatlity<br>
      2. from implied volatility -&gt; to local volatility.</p>
      <p>For second approach Paul Wilmott has derived a formula (assuming that there is continuous market data on V=V(S,T)).

  <p class="sectionheader">Risk Neutral</p>
  <p><span class="style1">Expected value</span>: for example, if the probability of receiving $1 is 50%, the value is $0.50 - this is called <span class="style1">'expected value'</span>.</p>
  <p>Pricing: take expected payoff value, discount back in time to today's date, adjust for risk.</p>
  <p>Two ways to price an asset:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Take an expected value - and adjust for risk. This is modeled using real world (physical) probabilities.</li>
    <li> &quot;Risk-neutral pricing&quot; - adjust the probabilities of future outcomes so that they incorporate the   effects of risk. Use these  virtual probabilities to calculate expectation.  Those adjusted virtual probabilities  are called &quot;<span class="style1">risk-neutral probabilities</span>&quot;.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Adjusting the probabilities in the 2nd method is a <span class="code">martingale measure transformation</span> (from physical measure <span class="style1">&quot;P&quot;</span> to  risk-neutral one <span class="style1">&quot;Q&quot;</span>). This transformation is possible if there are no arbitrage opportunities. If the markets are complete, <span class="code">the risk-neutral measure is unique</span>.</p>
  <p>So, <span class="style1">Risk-neutral measure</span> = <span class="style1">Equivalent martingale measure</span> =  <span class="style1">Q-measure</span> -  a probability measure which allows us to calculate the value of assets in a simple way. Namely,  we simply take  the <span class="style1">expected value</span> of the future payoff - and  <span class="style1">discount it at the risk-free rate</span>. No risk-adjustment is needed.</p>
  <p>Under the risk-neutral measure <span class="code">all assets have the same expected rate of return</span> -  the risk-free rate (or short rate). This is the <span class="style1">main benefit of using Q-measure</span>: once risk-neutral probabilities are found, every asset can be priced by simply taking its expected payoff. This is easier that using  the real-world  physical probabilities (P-measure) - where risk is different for   every security.</p>
  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk-neutral_measure">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk-neutral_measure</a></p>
  <p>Risk-neutral demonstrates that when pricing some assets, the real world probabilities assigned to future cash flows are irrelevant.</p>
  <p>The fundamental assumption behind risk-neutral valuation is to use a replicating portfolio of assets with known prices to remove any risk. The amounts of assets needed to hedge determine the risk-neutral probabilities.</p>
  <p class="sectionheader">Pricing</p>
  <p><span class="style1">Forward price</span> = delivery price at future time T. F = S*exp(r*(T-t)), where r - rate, S - current price. Using Ito we get: dF = (&mu;-r)Sdt + &sigma;SdW.</p>
  <p>Similar using Ito to find that function G(S,t) = ln(S) follows similar diff. equation. And solution is : ln(S(T)) = ln(S(t)) + K*N(m,s),</p>
  <p>where K - some coefficient, N - normal distribution, m=(&mu;-&sigma;<sup>2</sup>/2)(T-t) - mean value, and s = &sigma;*sqrt(T-t) - standard deviation.</p>

<p class="sectionheader">Lebesgue Iintegral</p>
  <p>Intuitive comparison between Riemann and Lebesgue integration:</p>
  <p>Problem: find a mountain's volume (above sea level).</p>
  <p>The Riemann-Darboux approach: Divide the base of the mountain into a grid of 1 meter squares. Measure the altitude of the mountain at the center of each square. The volume on a single grid square is approximately 1x1x(altitude), so the total volume is the sum of the altitudes.</p>
  <p>The Lebesgue approach: Draw a contour map of the mountain, where each contour is 1 meter of altitude apart. The volume of earth contained in a single contour is approximately that contour's area times its height. So the total volume is the sum of these volumes.</p>
  <p>In other words, the difference between the Riemann and Lebesgue approaches is that to compute the Riemann integral of f(x) on x in [a, b], we subdivie [a,b] into many small pieces,  whereas  in the Lebesgue method we  partition the range of the function f(x).</p>
  <p>Also note that Lebesgue approach can be applied to infinite and/or noncontinuous sets.</p>

    - cost of interest paid on a margin account (for long position)<br>
    -   cost of paying dividends (for short position)<br>
    -  opportunity cost (cost of  purchasing some other security  rather than an alternative).<br>
    - Generally refers to risk-free interest rate of some instrument (say, money-market) minus any future cash flows of investment into a similar product with similar risk.<br> 
    - Storage costs (should be added to the cost of carry for physical commodities such as corn, wheat, or gold.)</p>
  <p>The cost of carry model expresses the forward price (or, as an approximation, the futures price) as a function of the spot price and the cost of carry.<br>The same model in currency markets is known as interest rate parity.</p>
  <p>For example, a US investor buying a Standard and Poor's 500 e-mini futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange could expect the cost of carry to be the prevailing risk-free interest rate (around 5% as of November, 2007) minus the expected dividends that one could earn from buying each of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 and receiving any dividends that they might pay, since the e-mini futures contract is a proxy for the underlying stocks in the S&amp;P 500. Since the contract is a futures contract and settles at some forward date, the actual values of the dividends may not yet be known so the cost of carry must be estimated.</p>

  <p class="sectionheader">Forex</p>
  <p>The foreign exchange market (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forex" target="_blank">forex</a>, FX, or currency market) is a worldwide decentralized over-the-counter financial market for the trading of currencies. Typical transaction is exchanging 2 bags of money in different currencies. Each   party  purchases a quantity of one currency by paying a quantity of another currency.</p>
  <p>FX operates  24 hours a day except weekends, i.e. trading from 20:15 UTC on Sunday until 22:00 UTC Friday.</p>
  <p>Average daily turnover ~ 4 trillion $. About half of this is in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forex_swap" target="_blank" class="style1">foreign exchange swaps</a>.</p>
  <p>In comparison, the daily trading volume for US <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_market">bond market</a> is ~0.8 trillion (~500 bllion - treasures, ~250 - mbs agencies, ~75 - Fed.Agencies' securities, 23 minucipal, 23 corporate).</p>
  <p><span class="style1">Forex swap</span> consists of 2 legs: a <span class="style1">spot</span>  FX transaction, and a <span class="style1">forward</span> FX transaction. These two legs are executed simultaneously for the same quantity, and   therefore offset each other. It is also common to trade <em>forward-forward</em>, where both transactions   are for (different) forward dates.</p>
  <p>By far and away the most common use of FX swaps is for institutions to fund their foreign exchange balances.</p>
  <p>Once a foreign exchange transaction settles, the holder is left with a positive (or long) position in one currency, and a negative (or short) position in another. In order to collect or pay any overnight interest due on these foreign balances, at the end of every day institutions will close out any foreign balances and re-institute them for the following day. To do this they typically use tom-next swaps, buying (selling) a foreign amount settling tomorrow, and selling (buying) it back settling the day after.</p>
  <p>The interest collected or paid every night is referred to as the <span class="style1">cost of carry</span>. As currency traders know roughly how much holding a currency position will make or cost on a daily basis, specific trades are put on based on this; these are referred to as <span class="style1">carry trades</span>.<br>
