<b><font face="Verdana">Unix Command Line Editing</font></b>
<p>Using history and command line editing
<p>One of the great features of the C shell and the Korn shell is history.
The ability to recall and reuse commands that you have entered earlier
can save many keystrokes of repetitive typing. History and command line
editing are closely related. You may use command line editing to edit the
command that you are currently working on after you have typed it in, or
you may recall a previous command and then edit it.
<p>In this article, I will show you some of the ins and outs of history
and command line editing in the Korn shell. For history to work, you need
to be in the Korn shell, so begin by typing:
<p>ksh
<p>to launch a Korn shell.
<p>The second thing you need to make history work is an easy way to access
it. History is more than just the ability to recall previous commands;
it lets you recall commands and edit them before they are executed. The
Korn shell allows you to use different editing styles depending on what
you're trying to do. The primary editors are vi, emacs, and gmacs. I recommend
vi, as most people are familiar with it. History and command line editing
behave very differently depending on whether you are using vi, emacs, or
gmacs. I will cover some of these differences.
<p>To set vi up as your history editor type:
<p>set -o vi
<p>If you are going to continue to use history, you will want to include
this in your profile, or the emacs/gmacs equivalents. These set -o commands
only work in the Korn shell:
<p>set -o emacs
<br>or
<br>set -o gmacs
<p>Assuming that you have set -o vi as your history editor, you may now
access history. Press the escape key once (esc) and release it and press
k. The last command that you typed will appear on the screen:
<p>$ set -o vi
<p>Press enter and that command will be executed. Try a few more commands
so that you can accumulate some history. End with ls -l on the current
directory. Now press esc and k. The ls -l command appears once more. Press
k again and the command just prior to ls -l will appear. Each time you
press k you'll go back one more command in your history. The minus key
( - ) works in exactly the same way. I use the minus key because it's easier
for me to remember. Eventually, if you press k or minus enough times, you'll
end up back at the set -o vi command.
<p>Now press j or the plus key &lt; + > and you will move forward in the
command history. (When you are rapidly running back through history looking
for the command you need, and you realize you've passed it, it's good to
know how to move forward again.)
<p>If you have set -o emacs or gmacs, the keys are control-p for previous
command and control-n for next command. In vi you hit esc once and then
k or n will move you backward or forward through the commands. For emacs
and gmacs, use control-p or control-n each time.
<p>To view more of your history, type "history", and a list of your most
recent commands will be displayed along with numbers. If you see the number
of a command that you need, recall it by hitting the esc key, typing the
number of the command as displayed by history, and then typing an upper
case G. This will place the command with that number on the command line.
<p>Once you have located the command that you want, you can press enter
to execute the command, but you can also edit the command before executing
it.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Moving around in vi
<br>There are several vi commands for moving around the command line and
editing the line. I will only cover a few here. For further information
consult the manual on ksh. If you are familiar with vi you will recognize
the commands. The vi editor operates in two main modes. In command mode
single keys move the cursor, delete characters and perform other actions.
In input mode single keys are actually typed into the command line.
<p>Command Editing -- Cursor Movement in command mode for vi
<p>l (el)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Move the cursor forward one character
<br>h&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Move the cursor back
one character
<br>w&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Move the cursor forward
one word
<br>b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Move the cursor back
one word
<br>fc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Find character c in the
line
<br>0 (zero)&nbsp; Cursor to the start of the line
<br>$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cursor to the end
of the line
<p>l, h, w, f and b can be preceded by a number, thus 2b moves the cursor
back two words, and 3fx finds the third occurrence of x in the line. In
emacs and gmacs mode, cursor movement is different.
<p>Command Editing -- Cursor Movement in emacs/gmacs
<p>CONTROL-F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Move the cursor
forward one character
<br>CONTROL-B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Move the cursor
back one character
<br>ESCAPE then f&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Move the cursor forward one word
<br>ESCAPE then b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Move the cursor back one word
<br>CONTROL-A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cursor to the start
of the line
<br>CONTROL-E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cursor to the end
of the line
<p>The editing of a command line is not limited to history. You can also
edit a command line that you are currently typing in. For example type
the following, but do not press enter:
<p>ls -l
<p>You should be sitting with the cursor at the end of the command line.
If you have set -o vi then hit the esc key to exit input mode and enter
command mode. Now you can type h a few times and the cursor will move backward
through the command line. If you have set -o emacs, there is no need to
press esc, just start by typing control-b a few times, and the cursor will
move backwards.
<p>Now we have the cursor where we want it, but how do you actually edit
the command? There are several editing options, and again I am going to
describe just some of the more useful ones.
<p>Command Editing -- Editing keys in command mode for vi
<p>x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delete the character
over the cursor. Can be preceded by a count
<br>X&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delete the character
behind the cursor. Can be preceded by a count
<br>~ (tilde) Change case of the character over the cursor. Can be preceded
by a
<br>count
<br>u&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Undo the last change
to the line
<br>U&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Undo all changes
to the line
<br>a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter input mode
and begin inserting after the current character
<br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter input mode
and begin inserting at the end of the line
<br>i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter input mode
and begin inserting before the current character
<br>I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter input mode
and begin inserting at the beginning of the line
<p>You enter input mode by pressing a, A, i or I. To exit to command mode,
press the esc key.
<p>You may also press enter at any time, and the command as it appears
on the command line will be executed.
<p>In emacs and gmacs mode, you are always in input mode and normal characters
that are typed appear in the command line. Editing commands are given as
control + key or as esc + key ("key" is a variable).
<p>Command Editing -- Editing keys for emacs/gmacs
<p>CONTROL-D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delete the
character over the cursor
<br>ESCAPE then d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delete the current word
<br>CONTROL-C~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capitalize current
character
<br>ESCAPE then l&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Convert current character to
lower case
<p>In emacs and gmacs mode, you may also press enter at any time, and the
command, as it appears on the command line, will be executed.
<p>Remember that command line editing applies to the current command that
you are typing, or any other command that you have recovered from your
history.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Fun with file name completion
<br>The last piece of command line editing that I want to cover is file
name completion. This is usually used in current command lines but of course
it can also be used when editing a command retrieved from history.
<p>Assume a directory and file structure as follows and you are currently
in the abc directory.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>(dir)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
topdir</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
|</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-------------------------------</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
|</tt>
<br><tt>(dir)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
def&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ghi</tt>
<br><tt>(files)&nbsp; data.txt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; john.ltr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
news.doc</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; old.txt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
john.txt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weather.doc</tt>
<p>Type the following but do not press enter:
<p>ls -l d
<p>Now hit esc and then the backslash ( \ ). This causes the command line
editor to attempt to locate a file (or directory) that can be used to complete
the name that has been started. The search finds data.txt and that is typed
in on the command line:
<p>ls -l data.txt
<p>The cursor is left after the txt of data.txt ready for you to type anything
else that is needed to complete your command line.
<p>This also works for directories. Assume, for example, that you are in
the abc directory and need to edit news.doc in the ghi directory. You have
the option to go to that directory and begin editing, or simply issue a
vi command to edit directly from where you are:
<p>cd ../ghi
<br>vi news.doc
<p>or
<p>vi ../ghi/news.doc
<p>If you try the following sequence you will see the ( \ ) at work completing
the names for you. First type enough of the command to identify the directory:
<p>vi ../g
<p>Now type esc followed by ( \ ) and the directory name is completed for
you:
<p>vi ../ghi/
<p>Now type enough to uniquely identify the file by adding an n:
<p>vi ../ghi/n
<p>Press esc followed by ( \ ) and the file name is completed for you:
<p>vi ../ghi/news.doc
<p>This feature is especially useful for long directory and file names
and will save you much typing.
<p>If two or more files match what you have typed so far, the file completion
option will complete as much of the file as it can and then wait for you
to provide more unique input. To edit the file john.txt from one of the
adjacent directories type:
<p>vi ../def/j
<p>Press esc and backslash and it will fill in as much as it can and then
wait for you to indicate whether you want john.txt or john.ltr:
<p>vi ../def/john.
<p>The sequence that does this for emacs and gmacs is esc followed by a
second esc.
<p>There is much more to command line editing and history, but I have found
that just these few tips greatly speed up my work, and I hope they do the
same for you.
<p>If you like the idea of history, ask your system administrator to change
your shell to a Korn shell, and then be sure to add set -o vi, emacs or
gmacs into your .profile file.

<br><b><font face="Verdana">Main Editing Commands for emacs mode:</font></b>
<br>If you are using tcsh (T-C-shell), then command line editing is built-in
and you can simply use it.
<p>If you are using Korn shell (ksh), your login file (.profile) must contain
the line
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set -o emacs
<br>before command line editing will work. You can also type this at the
command prompt.&nbsp; This step is not necessary if your default shell
is tcsh
<p>Specific Editing Commands:
<br>Previous command:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^P
<br>Next command:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^N
<br>Back 1 character:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^B
<br>Forward 1 character:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^F
<br>Delete 1 character:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^D&nbsp; (NOTE: if you are not
editing a command, ^D will log you out.)
<br>Execute the retyped command:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ENTER> key
<p>Depending on the telnet program (terminal emulator) you are using, the
cursor control keys on your keyboard may work. Try it and see.&nbsp; If
so, then you only need remember how to delete a character.
<p>'Broken' Delete Key
<p>If the DELETE key produces unexpected results, there is a way to correct
this.&nbsp; If you type ^C (control-C) to abort the current command line,
and then carefully type:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stty erase [^H]
<p>where [^H] represents your pressing the key that you want to be a backspace/delete
key, and then press the ENTER key, then you will have reset the backspace/delete
key for your current session. You can also use and editor (pico, emacs,
or vi) to put this in your .login or .profile file and it will be set every
time you login.
<p>File name completion:
<p>Hitting the escape key twice after you have typed enough characters
of a file name to make it unique will enable the file-name completion feature
of ksh, and the shell will fill in the remainder of the file name for you.
