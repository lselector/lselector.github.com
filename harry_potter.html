<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>For twelve long years, the dread fortress of
Azkaban held an infamous prisoner named Sirius Black. Convicted of killing
thirteen people with a single curse, he was said to be the heir apparent
to the Dark Lord, Voldemort. Now he has escaped, leaving only two clues
as to where he might be headed: Harry Potter's defeat of You-Know-Who was
Black's downfall as well. And the Azkaban guards heard Black muttering
in his sleep, "He's at Hogwarts...he's at Hogwarts." Harry Potter isn't
safe, not even within the walls of his magical school, surrounded by his
friends. Because on top of it all, there may well be a traitor in their
midst.&nbsp;</td>

idea that we could have a child who escapes from the confines of the adult
world and goes somewhere where he has power, both literally and metaphorically,
really appealed to me."
<p>Like that of her own character, Harry Potter, J.K. Rowling's life has
the luster of a fairy tale. Divorced, living on public assistance in a
tiny Edinburgh flat with her infant daughter, Rowling wrote Harry Potter
and the Sorcerer's Stone at a table in a caf&eacute; during her daughter's
naps - and it was Harry Potter that rescued her. First, the Scottish Arts
Council gave her a grant to finish the book. After its sale to Bloomsbury
(UK) and Scholastic Books, the accolades began to pile up. Harry Potter
won The British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year, and the Smarties
Prize, and rave reviews on both sides of the Atlantic. Book rights have
been sold to England, France, Germany, Italy, Holland, Greece, Finland,
Denmark, Spain and Sweden.
<p>A graduate of Exeter University, a teacher, and then an unemployed single
parent, Rowling wrote Harry Potter when "I was very low, and I had to achieve
something. Without the challenge, I would have gone stark raving mad."
But Rowling has always written; her first book was called "Rabbit." "I
was about six, and I haven't stopped scribbling since."
<p>For Rowling, the change in her fortunes has been slightly bewildering.
But her daughter has no doubt about her mother's new career: when asked
what mommies do, she replies without hesitation, "Mommies write!"
